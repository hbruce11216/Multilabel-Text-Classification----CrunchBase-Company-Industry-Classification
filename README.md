# Multilabel-Text-Classification----CrunchBase-Company-Industry-Classification
Multilabel Classification Algorithm (NLP) for Categorizing Database of CrunchBase Companies into 87 Distinct Industries. Basis State works with small technology companies to find acquirers and help with exit strategies. They hired me to write a classification algorithm to sort their large dataset of companies into specific industries. 

My first attempt at tackling this project was rather naive. I was given a training dataset of 1,000 companies that had been manually classified into 87 unique industries and a training dataset of 50,000 companies that were unlabeled. Without doing any data exploration, I started throwing models at the data to see what worked. My goal was to classify companies into predefined industry classifications based on their 2-10 sentence descriptions. Unsurprisingly, this approach was unsuccessful. 

In this project, I attempt to use the various document similarity methods to shine light on the differences and similarities between Industry Classifications in a dataset of CrunchBase company data. While this classification problem is far from complete, I have a new sense of appreciation for the delicacy with which I need to approach this complex problem, if I ever expect to solve it.
