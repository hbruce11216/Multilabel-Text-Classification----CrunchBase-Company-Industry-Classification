These take under 5 minutes to post, and have zero obligation. In addition to the immediate benefits, companies can identify and evaluate job candidates, including those from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, and authentically assess job skills, cultural fit, and non-cognitive traits (e.g. grit, communication, teamwork, etc.). For college students and recent grads, Parker Dewey provides the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and grit, explore careers, develop their networks, and generate income as they seek internships and full-time roles. Furthermore, these authentic, experiential learning opportunities complement in-class instruction, thereby improving academic performance and driving completion. As a result, career launchers graduate more job-ready, and have the perspective and experience to find a full-time role with the right skill and cultural fit. Using data from these projects, Parker Dewey also provides insights to college and university faculty so that they can better align curriculum with job skills demanded by companies. In addition, these academic institutions can more effectively engage alumni and professors as mentors, counsel students on career options, and support existing and / or prospective corporate recruiters. Parker Dewey made it really easy for everyone to use the platform. It takes under five minutes to post a project (including setting the price and due date), career launchers apply only to those assignments that interest them, and companies select who they think is the best fit.

BambooHR,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bamboo-hr,http://www.BambooHR.com,"Human Resources, SaaS, Software","Administrative Services, Software",BambooHR is a SaaS-based company providing subscription-based HR software for SMEs.,"BambooHR is online HR software for small and medium-sized businesses that have outgrown using spreadsheets to manage their employee information. BambooHR is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company that provides small and medium-sized businesses with subscription-based online HR Software. HR professionals often refer to this type of software as a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) or Human Resource Management System (HRMS). BambooHR’s clients typically have between 50 and 500 employees and have outgrown the ability to use spreadsheets to track and manage their employee information.   Clients receive the following types of benefits from using BambooHR:   1) See all employee information in one location. BambooHR consolidates all of your employee information from all of your office locations into a single view. You can then access, control, sort, analyze, and take action on the data instantly—from your office, the road or home.   2) Spend less time on time off. Save hours of valuable time by using automated time off requests and approvals. Create your own categories of time off—like sick days, bereavement, jury duty and more. Set accrual policies. Track available and used time off.  And generate reports.   3) Control access for different types of users. The great thing about our software is that everyone can access the data they need—but only within the permissions you control. We make it easy to create custom user groups with different levels of access.   4) Generate reports with just a few clicks. Ah, reports—the bane of HR departments everywhere.  But now with just a few clicks, you can export data into beautiful reports—whether you use the reports we’ve already set up, or ones you create. They’ll all be automatically stored in the report library.   5) Get alerts. BambooHR ensures that your people won’t fall through the cracks. How? By making sure you never miss another training deadline, license renewal, birthday or benefit date. Our alerts feature notifies you of upcoming events, so you stay one step ahead.   6) Work globally. Our global settings support all popular currencies, so you can track payroll in pesos, yens, Euros—whatever the local currency is.  And for those of you who have offices in different corners of the world, we currently support six languages, so more people can see the software in their native tongue.   7) Integrate Applications. We have great partners integrated with our system, like payroll and applicant tracking. But we also have an open API, so it’s easy to integrate with other systems, including any you’ve built in-house.   - API. We think it’s important to play well with others. That’s why our API allows you to share data between systems—even if it’s with one you created—to support your internal needs and processes. It’s also great for creating unique internal workflows, business intelligence software syncing, and reporting needs. - Applicant Tracking Systems. BambooHR software is integrated with several recruiting and applicant tracking systems (ATS), so take your pick! This not only streamlines and manages your recruiting and hiring process, once a candidate is hired, information will automatically be saved in BambooHR and an employee record automatically created. Easy, from start to finish. - eSignatures. With our eSignature partnership, you can send documents out to be signed electronically right from your BambooHR account. The documents are then uploaded for you on the employee’s Documents tab with another copy available within the eSignatures software. Simple. Clean. Sweet. - Benefit Enrollment. We’ve integrated benefit enrollment software, so you can kiss those duplicate entry problems goodbye. And because your data syncs across systems, data errors could be history, too. - Payroll. Thanks to our payroll partnerships, new hire data, key field changes, terminations and more are all updated in the system in real time. That means you can see time off, pay stubs, and timesheets all in one place. - Performance Reviews. We’ve integrated performance applications so you can track reviews, goals, feedback, reports, you name it. Again, because your data syncs across systems, data errors could be a thing of the past.   8) Post Jobs. The BambooHR Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a new module that works hand in hand with BambooHR’s Core Human Resource Information System (HRIS). Found under the Job Openings tab, our new ATS helps Hiring Managers hire the right people fast by making applicant information responsive, collaborative, intuitive, and integrated. It also shares data seamlessly with BambooHR’s Core Human Resource Information System (HRIS).By eliminating double data entry, you can be confident that your employee information is always efficient, accurate and available. 9) Customize.

There are many segments of the U.S. talent acquisition market. The market is growing in many segments including staffing firms, which are expected to achieve $125 billion in revenue in 2015. One of the largest growing segments in the talent acquisition market are the recruitment software providers, which will grow to $3 billion in 2015 with growth rates of 14.3% over the past 5 years. Market experts estimate that the U.S. represents approximately one-third of the world market and that the Global Talent Acquisition Market exceeds $400 billion (Market Line).    Digi-Me believes that all players in the talent acquisition market – whether employers or their software and service providers – will benefit from the use of video for employment advertising and employer branding. Because Digi-Me’s target customers and service providers are global themselves, and because its cloud-based technology platform is global and completely scalable as well, management believes Digi-Me is capable of addressing the global talent acquisition market. Management estimates its video services potentially constitute 10% of the talent acquisition market, of which an estimated 10% is actually reachable by Digi-Me, resulting in a global, addressable market opportunity of $4 billion.    To provide perspective, the development of internet-based employment services enabled employers to eliminate 92% of newsprint classified ads from 2000 -2009, as classified ad spending dropped from $8.5 billion to $750 million.

A growing number of Fortune 500 companies are utilizing RecruitiFi's ERS platform to quickly fill their open positions with vetted, qualified talent. As an added benefit, the Expert Referral System streamlines agency interaction, allowing employers to manage their existing suppliers, vet new agencies, and utilize RecruitiFi's crowd of proven, expert recruiters at a low, flat placement fee.  How does it work for Employers?  Employers invite their current recruiting agencies to work at their existing fees, while leveraging RecruitiFi’s community at one low, flat fee. Recruiters are then scored in real time as employers view, sort, disposition, and hire their candidates. This allows the platform’s algorithms to match future jobs to a subset of qualified recruiters based on their performance on similar searches. The ERS eliminates the need to review recruiters based on anecdotal observations, automatically vetting new agencies and managing existing recruiters based on real data. It’s quick, confidential, easy, and taps into new pools of talent, resulting in higher quality candidates and a reduced time-to-hire.  How does it work for Recruiters?  Using a recruiter’s preferred industries, roles, and locations, the algorithm provides closely matching job requisitions (JobCasts). RecruitiFi actively vets all JobCasts, ensuring they have an active hiring need and do not have candidates in process. Additionally, the ERS platform requires detailed employer feedback, while RecruitiFi’s account managers provide a direct line of contact, eliminating the notorious ""Resume Black Hole."" The result: more transparency and more placement fees. Recruiters also enjoy a unique payment model that awards cash bonuses for quality candidates—even if they don't ultimately get hired!",http://www.linkedin.com/company/recruitifi,,http://twitter.com/RecruitiFi,http://www.facebook.com/recruitifi,"138,359"
