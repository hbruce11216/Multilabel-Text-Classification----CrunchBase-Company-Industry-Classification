WeatherRecord allows us to deliver near real time updates on weather conditions around the world to clients based on the thresholds they determine to be most important.   As the world’s businesses are becoming more agile, the ability to rapidly respond to external drivers that effect efficiency and profits has become critical. Weather is one of the biggest drivers in guiding these decisions but current weather observation systems are aging and unable to provide timely information. Imagine being able to make near real time updates to vehicle and aircraft routing, crop management, risk mitigation indexes, and giving first responders up to the minute information on disaster situations.   Our principals are from the NOAA/CU Center for Environmental Technology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Colorado Space Grant Consortium, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, and the aerospace industry.   OMS is launching GEMS with a payload of unique instruments to address the challenges above. Our key advantage is our proprietary, exclusively licensed cloud-penetrating microwave radiometer. The GEMS instrument suite gathers global weather data 30 times faster than current, aging satellite platforms, enabling us to improve many aspects of weather response. Our system can be built and deployed globally at a fraction of the cost of existing government (NASA/NOAA/DOD) systems. This opens the door for the first commercially viable global weather data company based on real observation, not rework of NOAA data sets.   The commercial weather data, market as determined by NOAA, is over $9 billion and is based on the reuse and rework of the same data that is available to everyone. Our focus markets are agriculture, risk mitigation, transportation, and governments. We offer our clients a unique premium and proprietary data set that will give them a market advantage.

Another key aspect of Edammo Technology is its ability to  provide highly accurate results even based on small amounts of training data. In addition, our solution is fully versatile and can be implemented as either a cloud-based service or a local application. The key proprietary advantages of the Edammo Data Analytics  solutions is its ability to process transient data in real-time and the ability to derive insights from even small amounts of training data. Stationary components can be learned by traditional machine learning methods as they are stable in time. Transient components are dynamically changing depending on independent factors not directly available to the user. Competitors use the approach of utilizing a high volume of stationary data, while identifying past patterns can help forecast future trends-this model cannot leverage dynamic data. In the wake of a highly volatile global economy, modern companies will be heavily defined by their ability to adapt and respond quickly to unexpected fluctuations in their environment.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/edammoinc,,,,"80,683"

"Casentric, LLC",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/casentric-llc,http://www.casentric.com,"Information Services, Information Technology",Information Technology,Enterprise application for insurers,"Casentric offers CaseXpert™, a cloud-based, enterprise software-as-as-solution application that helps property and casualty insurance companies and self-insured organizations to evaluate and resolve third party personal injury and property damage claims more accurately, faster and for less money. CaseXpert™ currently consists of four components. The first component is used by claims handlers to evaluate comparative fault (or liability) among two or more actors who contribute to an event of loss.  The second component is used to assess the extent of damages--such as pain and suffering, medical bills, and lost wages--that accrued from an event of loss.  The third component, reporting, provides certain pre-set reports and analyses on open cases and closed cases.  The company has developed a fourth component to provide real-time negotiation guidance to claims handlers during settlement negotiations to achieve improved settlement outcomes. The property and casualty insurance industry spends $225BN annually on personal injury and property damage claims. Companies spend approximately 75% of their revenue from insurance premiums on such claims, an amount that is rising due in part to rising medical costs. The vast majority of companies in the industry do not use any automated solution to help evaluate claims and, instead, rely on their individual claims handlers' experience to evaluate and resolve claims. This results in considerable variability in outcomes among claims handlers within companies and, importantly, no ability to measure outcomes and control expenses. Claims handlers today still substantially rely on handwritten, or unstructured, notes to record information, even though they handle far more cases and receive substantially less training than in the past. The industry is facing a significant shortage of claims handlers as many senior claims handlers will begin to retire in the next several years. Competing software applications exist, however, their penetration into the market has been hampered by their high complexity, high cost, and inability to reduce costs. Their proprietary ""blackbox"" approach also prevents claims handlers from understanding how to do their jobs and be successful in resolving claims.   CaseXpert™ takes a very different approach from these applications. Its intuitive framework makes learning and using the application fast and easy. The application presents a common framework for isolating the elements of a case and forcing claims handlers to think critically to understand the value of each element.  Claims handlers evaluate more information more efficiently, which enables them to more successfully negotiate and settle cases in less time and with better outcomes.  Casentric's first pilot at a small auto insurance company in 4Q2012/1Q2013 tested CaseXpert™'s liability component. Results showed that users applied more information to cases that they evaluated, which resulted in 3X more settlements using comparative negligence, 3X more success in settling cases at their assessed value, and 5 percentage point loss reduction, or $4.5MM/year.  Users gave positive feedback on CaseXpert™'s ease of use, its impact on their ability to understand their jobs better and learn, and resolve cases more successfully.   Casentric engaged in a second paid pilot with a second P&C insurance company in 4Q2013/1Q2014 to test its liability module. Results showed that CaseXpert™'s liability module was projected to achieve, initially, $1MM in cost reductions, or 1% of their annual expense spend, in 2014.  As of 1Q2014, Casentric has four paying customers, two of which are in pilot, and is building a customer pipeline, with a MRR of $9K and growing.  Along with additional reporting capabilities to show how claims handlers individually perform relative to one another, Casentric is demonstrating that claims handlers use more evidence and arguments with CaseXpert™, resulting in significant reductions in amounts paid by companies for claims by third parties for losses related to medical bills and pain and suffering, in addition to the portion of the losses for which their customers are responsible.   Casentric has been funded to date by its founders ($350K+), a $250K convertible note from JumpStart, Inc., a Cleveland-based nonprofit venture association, and a $100K nonrecourse note from a local county economic development fund.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/casentric,,,,"86,616"

These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation. All mentioned issues makes customers unsure and unsatisfied. Autonomous/self-driving From the autonomous/self-driving point of view the goals are: decimeter grade of absolute positioning within a global reference frame, relative localization/location displacement estimation accuracy – 10 cm per 100 sec, speed estimation accuracy – 5 cm/sec, course estimation accuracy – 0,1-0,5 deg. Effective integration of navigation and machine control information sources as GNSS, IMU (gyro, accelerometer), 3D compass, Digital Map, Radar, Lidar, Image-based Positioning and Computer Vision. Solution to the navigation/positioning task mainly within GNSS+IMU+3DMap+Image-based Positioning techs. To allocate the Computer Vision and Radar/Lidar techs mostly for obstacle avoidance, objects recognition and machine control functions. Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic approach to urban mobility and autonomous/self-driving technology solution concludes in deep engineering synthetic navigation design consist of: tight couple integration of GNSS with internal sensors (IMU) using raw data of satellite receiver, map based corrections (road graph and turns matching), image-based positioning (reference points detection and images recognition; no permanent scene analysis typical for obstacle avoidance, no high power and computation consumption). The software only product using just a platform sensors running on smartphones and in-dash auto systems. Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis.  Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers. Demonstration of results The video of the technology real time tests on Android smartphone will be demonstrated in the frame of presentation. Interested customers will be welcome for field tests.
