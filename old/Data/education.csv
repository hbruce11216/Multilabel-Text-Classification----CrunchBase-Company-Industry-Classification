This is partially due to its unique approach to education, which stresses the importance of independent study. Princeton’s undergraduate academics grant bachelor’s degrees in the arts and sciences. In their third and fourth years, all undergraduates must pursue independent research in their chosen field of study. Depending on your major and academic goals, this can vary from a lab research to a creative project. The graduate school at Princeton University offers a variety of master’s degrees and Ph.D.’s, as well as continuing education programs to suit diverse academic needs. The graduate school does not use a credit-based system, and your department and advisor will determine your curriculum. Tuition at Princeton is among the most expensive in the country. In light of this, the university aims to support its students with significant financial assistance. Princeton’s need-based financial aid program replaces loans with grants, so that its students won’t be overwhelmed with debt after graduation. These programs and more are available to those who qualify. Tuition costs shouldn’t discourage qualified students to apply to Princeton. As an Ivy League school, Princeton’s admissions are highly competitive.Contact the school directly for more information and guidance on applying.",http://www.linkedin.com/edu/princeton-university-18867,,http://twitter.com/princeton,http://www.facebook.com/18058830773,"7,602"

More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.

We are in the early growth stages of taking our product to market and are hiring.  LRM is a new category of product that fills a major void in the education technology market by helping organizations to organize complex learning relationships and ensure that all learners benefit from them.  Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems are essential to execute the transactions of modern education and they drive efficiency and standardization. But they do so at the expense of relationships.  And we think that relationships are absolutely essential to learning. People are motivated to learn because the content is related to their long term goals. They learn in context of their relationships with peers, teachers, mentors, and a community of other learners. They learn because they want to progress and form relationships with companies and societies that require expertise and credentials.  If you analyze the most pernicious problems in education from the skills gap to attrition to professional development, you’ll find inadequate learning relationships to be at the root cause of everything.  Most learning organizations understand this and are trying to fill that relationship void with Customer Relationship Management software. But CRM is designed for sales and is insufficient to the task of managing learning relationships because CRMs treat the contact as a passive participant to be acted upon by sales people. Fidelis’ LRM recognizes that learners have to be active drivers of their own success and provides them a beautiful way to organize the relationships that they need to succeed.  Given how important learning is to every organization, to society, and to democracy, we think that someone is going to build a multi-billion dollar company selling LRMs - we hope it's us.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/fidelis-inc/,,https://twitter.com/fidelised,,"25,964"

VideoKen is an AI-based platform that makes informational videos rich and consumable. It uses AI techniques to automatically index videos, creating table-of-contents and phrase cloud, which nicely summarize key topics in a video, and lets viewers jump directly to the topics of interest within a video. It also supports more effective video search (without a reliance on manual tags), lead generation for businesses, and rich insights into video viewing behavior of the target audience. Problem Statement: Videos account for roughly 75% of the internet traffic. Enterprises are using informational videos for employee learning, sales enablement, marketing and internal communication. However, the intended viewers rarely have the time and patience to watch more than a few minutes of these videos. On a related note, although millions of learning videos are freely available, covering practically any topic, it is well known that learners get disengaged very quickly. VideoKen is transforming the way people consume and utilize informational videos, and in the process, also creating value for the organizations creating the video content. Example: Here are some of the sample links that illustrate how hard it is to peer inside and navigate long videos on the popular (and powerful) YouTube platform, and the difference made by AI-based techniques (explained below) in VideoKen. 1.

The first idea for Oyalabs came about when our founder's first son was born with a congenital medical condition and he was looking for a science-based resource for parents to ensure they are stimulating not just physical but also cognitive development of their child - knowing 0-3 is the most critical period for intervention as 90% of the brain grows then.

Our technology has been shown to improve a child's language and cognitive outcomes in a research trial and has won the Best of BabyTech Learn & Play award at CES 2018.   Based on the data and interactive curriculum in the Wunder app, the platform recommends parents age-appropriate activities, books and toys to teach and motivate parents to provide the most stimulating learning experience for their everyday bonding.

Current travel-tracking solutions are antiquated and ineffective. To the extent a school has the foresight and maturity to offer products and services like emergency contact cards or check-in apps, students are overwhelmingly unaware or disengaged. The schools own the risk but are flying blind. In fact, nearly 70% of students did not report their side-trips and/or their independent off-campus travel while on school-sponsored programs. The information gap is bad for everyone. Students need safety and security services, but don’t voluntarily adopt them, even when available or made mandatory. Social connections, adventure, and budget drive student travel behaviors. Safety and security are after-thoughts or “no-thoughts”—third on their totem pole of travel anxieties. When something goes wrong, the school is exposed not only to incident-related loss and expense, but disproportionate harm to reputation, and to strategic objectives to promote wide use of study abroad options.  For this reason, we created OffWeGo, a student-centric, mobile-first solution equally valuable and appealing to university risk managers and student travelers. We streamline the data collection of student travel by bundling key safety features from our travel assistance partners, with social and monetary incentives that keep students engaged and an active participant in the reporting process. We send this data to the student's university to aid the university's duty of care, so they can properly advise and assist the travelers once they've departed.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/offwego-llc/,,https://twitter.com/offwegotrips,https://www.facebook.com/offwego.io/,"56,478"
