Academic Room,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/academic-room,http://www.academicroom.com,"EdTech, Education","Education, Software",Academic Room is an online marketplace to curate scholarly content from journal articles to course lectures.,"Academic Room (http://www.academicroom.com) is the first multidisciplinary knowledge platform where you can build open communities to organize academic content within well-defined practice areas—ranging from philosophy, history and economics to engineering, architecture and medicine. The platform also dramatically reduces time to locate, both, credible scholarship and experts within a field of research. Academic Room was a finalist in 2012 Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) Awards and 2013 EdTech Digest Awards Program for its ability to harness and broker resources and talent across its open communities. Academic Room is headquartered in the Harvard Innovation Lab. Access to educational knowledge, along with the process of its discovery, is an intractable problem, resulting in 3.7 billion related searches every month. ""Researchers—be they senior scholars or freshmen—no longer make the library the first stop in their search for knowledge. The shift from producing and consuming information in hard copy to multimedia digital form has moved the center of information gravity from research libraries to the Internet."" Search engine algorithms rank content that has gone through search engine optimization (SEO) making it more difficult to find more specific high quality academic content. To make matters worse, academic content is becoming increasingly complex and varied, posing an enormous challenge to organize it within traditional web portals. Given these limitations, not surprisingly, the delivery of content occurs haphazardly through disparate websites that often have little to do with education. For instance, today’s students and professors must scour library catalogs for books; video sites for lectures; journal databases for articles and reviews; job boards for career opportunities; and search engines for content such as bibliographies, data sets, lecture notes, syllabi and past exams. As research increasingly becomes interdisciplinary, there is a pressing need for a platform that is social and facilitates both permanent curation and discovery of knowledge. Academic Room’s knowledge management capabilities bring order to this chaos by providing the technology and semantic framework to organize content—in all its complexity—into well-defined subject areas. Because raw and published content is no longer scattered, but rather curated in one central location within specialized social communities on the platform, there emerge a number of opportunities to build a meaningful ecosystem of services around academic disciplines. For instance, Columbia University's Center for Development Economics and Policy (CDEP) uses Academic Room to curate working papers, journal articles and events for its global audience of thought leaders. CDEP also runs a multi-author blog on Academic Room.  Similarly, faculty from Harvard University use Academic Room to engage with industry and announce new projects. Academic Room provides single-search discovery of relevant content in all formats (article, book, review, video, audio, image, bibliography, syllabus, dissertation, manuscript) to granular levels. By adding a social networking layer to the platform, content producers and consumers—whether institutions or individuals—are able to create their profiles, dynamically update content they have authored, and engage with other users in discussion groups and blogs. Academic Room was conceived as a content platform with the larger vision of collaboration in mind from its very inception because other existing solutions are mere social networks that lack the capability to create structured repositories of knowledge.",,,http://twitter.com/academicroom,http://www.facebook.com/academicroom

Families connect via a mobile app to search, discover, and create local experiences to share with their young children. The Adventure Clubs free mobile app offers an opportunity for families with young children to easily create beautiful childhood memories. Forget about those cumbersome lists of what to do with kids in a particular city. Just because something exists doesn’t mean there will be any other families there when you go. And we all know, everything is more fun in a group.  Our kids need education, socialization and stimulation, and so do we. That’s why Adventure Clubs exists. This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for?

On occasion, BeagleBoard.org provides for the promotion of communication with other individuals interested in open-source software and hardware. BeagleBoard.org is the result of an effort by a collection of passionate individuals, including several employees of Texas Instruments, interested in creating powerful, open, and embedded devices. We invite you to participate and become part of BeagleBoard.org, defining its direction. Support for BeagleBoard.org boards comes from the very active development community through this website, the mailing list, and the IRC channel. Original production funding was provided by Digi-Key, a major international distributor, but distribution has now been opened up to dozens of distributors across the world. On-going funding for board prototypes has been provided by manufacturing partners. Texas Instruments generously allows Jason Kridner, community manager and software cat herder, to spend time to provide support and development of the BeagleBoard.org project as part of their duties at TI. Manufacturing partners pay volume prices for the TI (and all other) components. BeagleBoard.org licenses the use of BeagleBoard.org logos for use as part of the Manufacturer, Compliant and Compatible logo programs . BeagleBoard.org also participates as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code which pays a small fee for mentoring students. The first five BeagleBoard.org designs (BeagleBoard, BeagleBoard-xM, BeagleBone, BeagleBone Black and BeagleBoard-X15) where all executed by BeagleBoard.org co-founder Gerald Coley of EmProDesign. All the designs are fully open source and components are available for anyone to manufacture compatible hardware. We do request contact and permission before considering the use of the BeagleBoard.org name on any products. The boards are low-cost, fan-less single-board computers based on low-power Texas Instruments processors featuring the ARM Cortex-A series core with all of the expandability of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. Initially, development was targeted at enabling Linux distributions to improve support for ARM devices. With tremendous success and support by numerous Linux distributions, development has become more focused on enabling simplified physical computing on advanced GUI-enabled and/or networked-enabled devices with a super-simple out-of-box learning experience and support for development environments familiar to just about every developer, from Ubuntu, QNX, Windows Embedded, Android and web tools to bare metal and even Arduino/Wiring-style programming.",https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1474607/profile,,http://twitter.com/beagleboardorg,http://www.facebook.com/beagleboard

This should be a time every teenager looks forward to without any worry of violence or crime because they are being attentively protected for the case of extreme danger. Right now, that isn’t entirely true.” - Sean Levinson, Elite Daily, April 11, 2013 Never-Before-Offered, In-The-Moment, Mobile Conflict Resolution & Mediation Caroami is an online conflict resolution and mediation platform operated through a messaging interface. It uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and Machine Learning to resolve conflicts in-the-moment, before they escalate, such as roommate disputes, dating issues, ghosted friendships, unfriended pals, gender politics, and sexual harassment. The millennial market looks for an instant, mobile, and electronic solution to conflict.  $2.9B Market Opportunity Higher education institutions are in turmoil, and Caroami is ready to step in to help at this pivotal time with our unique offering. The college experience has always been demanding, and students face a range of interpersonal problems that determine their success or failure. Add to that the effect mobile and social technology has had on the social skills of students entering college in recent years leaving them without adequate negotiating or communication skills to resolve disputes. Even though 98% of the 83.1M Millenials in the US use a smartphone, there is no digital tool on the market that provides an instant, mobile, or confidential way to help them resolve interpersonal conflict. Traditional, off-line mediation solutions are time-intensive, cumbersome, and extremely costly. In addition to higher education, Caroami is poised to serve corporate users, HOAs, courts, government, and the military with a market potential of $2.9B and growing. The future of conflict resolution is digital, instantaneous, and mobile, and is currently not being adequately served. Workplace discrimination against employees based on race, gender, or sexual orientation costs businesses an estimated $64 billion annually, not including the cost to their reputation or workplace morale. When companies buy harassment insurance, they are not protecting the victims. Caroami protects both the end user and the organization. Value Proposition From frazzled to happy, students can now use Caroami to resolve their roommate disputes, gender politics, sexual harassment, and other issues at the moment with our messaging interface-based mobile which replaces the slow, inadequate, and rather public Facebook and Twitter apps they are currently using for this purpose. Colleges, universities, and other organizations can avoid costly settlements, expensive lawyers, and hits to their reputations with the help of our app that affordably uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and ML to guide students to de-escalate potential violence and restore relationships that have gone awry. It also has applications in cases of gender, religion, and identity politics that pose legal, PR nightmares, and attrition, all while keeping problems internal to the organization.  Happy students turn into happy alumni and future donors. Paying clients will receive data/analytics to better plan next academic year. Employers can identify and prevent problems way before they escalate. Students will learn to resolve conflicts over time, promote wellness, and preserve friendships. Tri-Revenue Model Using a B2B, SaaS model, we offer: 1.	Freemium and Premium services with an analytics add-on for a licensing agreement 2.	Additional wellness and safety modules 3.

The number of high-schoolers that pursue science, technology, and engineering is not high enough to fill the job openings within Chicago’s growing technology sector. In 2008, Mayor Daley recognized the workforce need and challenged us to create a public school that would match students with the right curriculum, teaching approach and connections to industry to inspire a new generation of technology leaders. Unlike other successful urban high schools, Chicago Tech Academy doesn’t impose barriers like location, money, or skill level on acceptance. We seek students that are motivated by the power of technology and excited about special opportunities to build critical relationships within their desired field. Outside of standard subjects like math and reading, students take 2 technology classes per day, learning everything from mobile app development to project management. By the time they’re seniors, students are able to work on a team consulting clients on their development and design needs. Many students are being held to a higher academic standard than they have been their entire life, and it’s working; ChiTech students show 2-5 times more academic growth in a year than the average CPS student. Students are also paired with a dedicated, one-to-one mentor as part of Generation Tech Mentoring. Mentors guide career exploration and set high expectations for students. Students learn how to think and act like a professional from their mentor.  We’re in our third year and looking forward to graduating our first class in 2013.
