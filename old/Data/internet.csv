The underlying technology uses computer vision, machine learning, and cloud-based infrastructure to teach computers to see and understand the world around them. Initially, the technology was applied to develop an agricultural model to analyze corn and soy production in the United States. Using imagery from various satellite constellations, weather data, and other datasets, the model accurately predicted yield six months prior to the end of the growing season. Realizing the potential for the technology applied to use cases around the globe, Descartes Labs turned its focus to developing a cloud-based supercomputing platform for the application of machine intelligence to massive data sets. This platform could be used by anyone to develop intelligent learning models to do science on data, and make that data actionable.  Capitalizing on the confluence of advances in AI and high-performance cloud computing – along with the rapid increase of sensors capturing information all over the globe – Descartes Labs has created an enterprise data refinery that enables organizations to model – and predict changes in – natural resources and the entire value chains in which they live. With an initial focus on satellite imagery, Descartes Labs processes a pipeline of data flows from all the major satellite constellations, at scale, to provide instant access to analysis-ready images of the entire world via a massive, searchable, on-demand interface. For example, petabytes of imagery can be searched and retrieved, and all features from various constellations accessed, in under 100 milliseconds.  By collecting, normalizing, and presenting science-ready data generated by satellites, the Descartes Labs Platform is advancing and accelerating unique applications of machine intelligence for consumers, corporations, and governments worldwide. Descartes Labs is headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with offices in San Francisco, Los Alamos, and New York City.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/9412387,,https://twitter.com/DescartesLabs,https://www.facebook.com/DescartesLabs/,"3,750"

The company's two main products today include the original BitTorrent software and the tiny-but-mighty µTorrent, which combined boast over 150+ million users. BitTorrent is based in San Francisco, Calif. and is backed by Accel Partners and DCM. BitTorrent is a globally-recognized creator of software and technology designed to help help people find, share and move digital media over the Internet. The company has built an orchestrated ecosystem of software, content and devices, all designed in harmony with the legendary BitTorrent protocol at the core. The BitTorrent Protocol, invented by founder Bram Cohen in 2001, makes massive files move efficiently over the Internet. Software The original BitTorrent and the iconic µTorrent are the world's most popular torrent software clients. They make it fast and easy for people to find, download, share, and play large files over the Internet. Content BitTorrent is currently building unique features to easily transform, play and share large personal media files (e.g. home movies, smartphone videos, and hi-res photos) with friends and on on BitTorrent partner devices. Through the Spotlight Artist program, users also have direct access to a library of artist-endorsed indie films, music, games and books.

The BitTorrent Certified Devices Partner Program enables consumer electronics makers to join the BitTorrent community, reach a global audience, and solve fundamental user challenges with moving personal content to home devices.

It enables faster file transfers by downloading pieces of a file from multiple sources and concurrently uploading pieces to other users, overcoming the asymmetrical nature of upstream and downstream bandwidth. Many companies, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Blizzard, leverage the BitTorrent protocol to make files move faster. µTP or micro-transport protocol µTP is an intelligent BitTorrent protocol engineered to self-throttle when sensing network congestion, yielding capacity to priority traffic. The result? BitTorrent does not contribute to congestion on home networks or global ISP backbones. BitTorrent also contributes through more broadly-focused standards bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) at the LEDBAT working group http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ledbat-charter.html.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/bittorrent,,http://twitter.com/BitTorrent,http://www.facebook.com/bittorrent,"5,172"

Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams. Some of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community. So, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots – for however long you're planning to be there – we are the answer. Renting is the new American lifestyle. We didn’t create it, but we're making it sing.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/belonghq/,,https://twitter.com/joinbelong/,https://www.facebook.com/belonghome/,"6,546"
