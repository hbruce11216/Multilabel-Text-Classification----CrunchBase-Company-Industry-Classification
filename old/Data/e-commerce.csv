We realized this vision stretched beyond the name SpaBooker, leading us to spin out as GramercyOne, with SpaBooker as its product. Shortly thereafter, we brought on new investors in our Series A financing of $14.5M, enabling us to build out our executive team, enter several new verticals, and sign new partnerships with major publishers. Over the following year, as we continued our breakout growth, we recognized that our name was creating an unneeded divide between our company and our products.

It takes seconds to navigate the app and minutes for goPuff’s Driver-Partners to deliver the customer’s needs and wants. goPuff’s strategically located facilities cut out the middleman allowing for a flat fee of $1.95.   goPuff’s success has allowed the company to support important causes.

Arhaus designers search the world looking for eclectic designs and pieces to share with clients and customers at Arhaus locations, bringing back vivid furniture from master artisans. Arhaus was founded in 1986 by Jack Reed and his son John. The first store opened in downtown Cleveland as part of the Flats district in a building from the 1840s; thirty years later Arhaus now has locations in over 25 states. The store’s name was inspired by the Danish city Aarhus; after seeing the name, John Reed found a variation that conveyed an international feeling, combining his original inspiration with the German word for house. Jack Reed had a vision of a company that would sell unique products sourced from all over the world. Arhaus has partnered with vendors for over twenty years to ensure quality and consistency; vendors become more than just business partners, they become friends and family as both businesses expand. CEO John Reed says, “as we grow, they grow.” Arhaus works with vendors across the world to find handcrafted one-of-a-kind products. Amish-Americans in Ohio dry wood for years to create the Live Edge collection; iron artisans in Mexico forge iron frames for bar stools by hand. Arhaus buys directly from manufacturers who share the Arhaus vision for quality, design, and sustainability. Since the beginning of the company Arhaus has been committed to sustainability, and today Arhaus demonstrates those values through a philanthropic partnership with American Forests. Arhaus has never used wood from endangered forests in their furniture–all of the wood used today is sustainably sourced or recycled.

In addition, they spend significant sums with Google and Facebook to drive awareness and traffic, often with minimal ROI. MassGenie helps brands and retailers reduce their reliance on marketplaces, while decreasing their advertising investments with Google and Facebook by leveraging our patent pending Power Buy SaaS and AI/ML. MassGenie’s journey  was started in early 2015 by inventor and female Co-Founder, Thu Truong https://www.linkedin.com/in/thutruong/, who created  the Power Buy concept and infrastructure. Power Buys are short term, volume-based offers where buyers can use their social media influence to crowdsource demand. We spent two years developing the Power Buy technology, including creating a marketplace to prove the concept. A patent was filed for the Power Buy concept and technology in early 2016.  The MassGenie Marketplace officially launched in mid 2017.  Utilizing the Power Buy technology, buyers were able to leverage the power of social shopping and sharing to drive prices down. Not only did MassGenie prove the Power Buy concept, our marketplace growth was impressive. GMV grew from $311K in 2017, to $4.6 million in 2018, to $7.7 million in the first half of 2019.   MassGenie is now moving onto the next chapter of our journey, which is to make the Power Buy technology available to brands and retailers worldwide. Any brand or retailer with an ecommerce site via Shopify, Magento and BigCommerce or their own custom site, can take advantage of the Power Buy via a SaaS offering. MassGenie has also established strategic partnerships with a number of major ecommerce companies in Asia to help grow the Power Buy concept throughout that region.  MassGenie has also been working on our AL/ML engine for predictive analytics and demand sensing for Power Buy. This will allow us to service those brands and retailers that have the Power Buy SaaS technology on their own ecommerce site with AI-driven solutions while delivering optimized pricing and cross-sell, upsell and retention insights.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppowerbuy/,,,https://www.facebook.com/powerbuyapp/,"19,618"
