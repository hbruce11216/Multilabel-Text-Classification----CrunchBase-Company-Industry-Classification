After opening two centers in Atlanta and one Preferred Scan Center in Athens, GA and one in Charlotte, NC, we realized the need to offer our dental practice clients Digital Lab service after each patient scan. In order to best serve our dental practice clients, we decided to pursue the development of the 360 Digital Lab, that offered complete Implant treatment related services including Radiology Reports, Conversion and Image Modeling and Treatment Planning services. After planning over 30,000 cases over 6 years, we saw the shortcomings of the software packages on the market and saw an opportunity to simplify the planning process through a superior software option that would work with any type of implant. That led to the development of 360dps; a comprehensive, cost-effective and intuitive implant planning software designed to make implant planning painless.  In addition, the backups and delays on surgical guides coming from overseas were a constant problem. In response, we have developed a state-of-the-art technology to produce surgical guides here in Atlanta, GA.

This smart sensor basketball uses its patented point-of-force technology to help athletes more rapidly develop muscle-memory. The basketball measures key motor skills, learns the strengths and weaknesses of players at any level, and adapts as the player improves.  While wearing Glass, basketball players receive visual and audio shot feedback in real time for skills including shot arc, shot release speed, and backspin.  With a range of over 100 yards, the basketball communicates with Glass via bluetooth to display key metrics necessary to build better shooting skills. The Glassware includes three key shooting analyses tools: Shot Arc Analyzer, Shot Release Speed Timer, and Shot Backspin Analyzer. The Glassware instantly overlays shooting data into the field of view for the shooter or coach, helping the user visualize the quality of each shot.  The data makes it easier for the player to adjust mechanics, improve shooting range, develop a softer shot, or simply become a better free throw shooter. It can be used by the coach watching the player, or by the player practicing on his or her own. 94Fifty has also introduced apps that are now available for Glass, iOS 7, and Android, which provides athletes the ability to share their achievements with friends, family, and coaches via social media. 4Fifty Smart Sensor Basketball is the official smart basketball of the National Association of Basketball Coaches and has been endorsed by the Amateur Athletic Union Basketball (AAU).",,,http://twitter.com/94fifty,http://www.facebook.com/94Fifty

Neurons and Synapses are represented by Polymorphic Object Oriented Multidimensional Map Space and Connection Vectors respectively. This Neural Network includes a Cortex for each type of abstract data becoming an Unsupervised Learning Convolutional Network. This constantly growing group of datasets become A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s knowledgebase and every time a specific synapse is accessed it glows on a 3D working model representing the process of active thinking by exciting the neurons of a certain synapse in multiple abstaction layers autonomously. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. appears to be conscious when inputs of any kind are compared against it's neural network, matching and identifying with Fuzzy Logic algorithms and self-learning new patterns as unknown datasets are presented and analyzed by each one of the Cortexes. This identification of patterns along with specific rules, pre-set objectives, directives, accuracy and restriction parameters are used to identify any desired optimum working area. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. then presents recommendations, predictions, corrective actions and feedback as a closed loop control system but talking human language, thus, effectively showing the behavior of Artificial Intelligence. The polymorphic nature of A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s Object Oriented Inheritance layers under unsupervised learning enable the processing of any pattern of any size and any dimension. Storing references, concepts, types, properties, values, 3D datasets, stereo images, audio, statistics, characteristics and classes all with inheritance properties in a polymorphic multidimensional abstract layers allows A.I.L.E.E.N.N. to receive, store, compare and identify datasets of any kind against it's current knowledge in memory and compare it to overtime and realtime behavior samples.

In March 2012, ATC acquired a 66.6% interest in United States Patent 6,298,328.  In October 2012, ATC announced it acquired the remaining 33.4% of the patent. The patent covers an invention that changed the course of transcription services for the modern era. Specifically, rather than transcribing voice live, ATC's patent uses telecommunications equipment so professionals could transmit their voice to a central data center while the transcription service returned it in text format.   Since the invention in 1999, the technological idea is believed to have been copied by various companies including Samsung, through its S-Voice platform, Apple's Siri system for its iPhone and iPads, along with software provided for mobile phones from companies such as VLink, Inc. Other companies may have also infringed on the technology by using similar systems and programs to provide voicemail to text services which are being used by Vonage and other telecommunications providers. Even certain McDonalds restaurants have implemented the technology for their drive in windows. Teaming together with Pennsylvania Patent Prosecution Corporation and management consultants from Accredited Business Consolidators Corp., ATC will vigorously pursue the royalties that it believes are owed to it. ATC is in the process of notifying infringers of its patent and the royalties they may owe.

Families connect via a mobile app to search, discover, and create local experiences to share with their young children. The Adventure Clubs free mobile app offers an opportunity for families with young children to easily create beautiful childhood memories. Forget about those cumbersome lists of what to do with kids in a particular city. Just because something exists doesn’t mean there will be any other families there when you go. And we all know, everything is more fun in a group.  Our kids need education, socialization and stimulation, and so do we. That’s why Adventure Clubs exists. This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for?

The B2B buying journey is more complex and multifaceted than it’s ever been. Sales cycles are longer and more individuals are involved in buying decisions, each with their own roles and priorities. They’ve also entered a new era where buyers are discovering and learning about companies through multiple online touchpoints, making content the centerpiece of their buying journey. These changes require that successful B2B marketers be buyer-centric.

Achieving this, however, is dependent on having a truly deep understanding of your buyers. The challenge marketers face is that existing technologies do not fully support this shift from being vendor-centric to buyer-centric because they’re solely focused on execution.

Alacritech eliminates corporate storage/NAS sprawl by extending the life of the enterpriseâ€™s existing storage framework while reducing the dependency on growing pools of over-provisioned and underutilized disk drives. Only Alacritech allows enterprises to drastically increase application performance without having to replace the investment made in the NFS-based storage network. Alacritech was founded in 1997 by technology pioneer Larry Boucher, the author of the SCSI standard and founder of both Auspex and Adaptec. Larry and his team of fellow entrepreneurs foresaw the convergence of storage and networking and the large amount of processing power and bandwidth consumed when moving data across the network. To solve this problem, the team designed Dynamic TCP Offload and cast it into silicon and has now taken it a step further by leveraging this technology in the form of an NFS acceleration appliance. By applying its vision of accelerated storage/NAS solutions and leveraging its 54 patents in the area of network acceleration, Alacritech is redefining the next generation of enterprise storage, allowing companies to accelerate their existing storage/NAS infrastructure.",,,http://twitter.com/alacritech,

This mission required rethinking the entire installation process and not simply making incremental improvements to existing rack systems, which initially copied and retained many of the same materials used for small, residential roof systems.   Alion specifically designed a more efficient construction process for utility scale solar plants by using robotic installation technology and established construction industry practices.   Now, Alion Energy builds utility scale systems twice as fast and with less than half the labor.   At Alion Energy, we go beyond simply building the most cost-effective utility scale solar systems; we build solar plants with LCOEs that can compete with any generation source.",,,,

Passengers demand a lot from their airlines these days: zero tolerance for unexpected delays to the cheapest rate possible is becoming the norm. Customers are also hyper-informed about airlines' average delay times and comparative rates. And with new tools such as Google Flights for instance, they’re beginning to make decisions based on these facts. AlulA has developed a simple solution that can push the aviation industry closer to the Holy Grail: combining competitive airfares with happier customers, via fewer unexpected and expensive flight delays. Delays cost airlines, and therefore passengers a lot of money, time and frustration. The good news is: Many unexpected delays can be avoided, if only the right people had the right information to make critical decisions before critical failures occur. AlulA is taking advantage of the untapped potential of an existing global network of tiny antennas, which already exist in thousands of homes worldwide. Upgrading these inexpensive versions of large radio towers allows this network to collect valuable aircraft data from planes passing overhead. This crowd then forwards AlulA the data they collect, and enables AlulA to retrieve live aircraft health data. This then allows airplane maintainers to see problems starting to arise before they result in expensive component failure, which costs airlines upward of $8.00 a second, or nearly $30,000 an hour of downtime, and ultimately cost you the passenger higher average airfares and frustration of missing your connecting flight due to unexpected delays. AlulA’s mission is to provide a cost effective, universal solution for aircraft data streaming . AlulA offers a unique system to affordably broadcast aircraft data in real-time, which we refer to as beyond 4D (beyon4d).",https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasbyrd/,,https://www.twitter.com/alulaaero,https://www.facebook.com/alulaaerospace

Every day, millions of test strips are used in order to make a myriad of chemistry of measurements. Many of these strips rely on user interpretation of colors or indicator lines in order to make estimations of analyte concentrations. For this reason, test strips are often viewed as “semi-quantitative” or even just simply “qualitative.” We realize that there exists tremendous opportunity to leverage the native capabilities of today’s smartphones with their massive install bases in order to convert “quick-and-dirty” test strips to powerful tools for rapid quantitative measurement. Our platform, LabStrip, is designed to transform the iPhone 4 series of smartphone into a deployable mobile laboratory. Each lot of test strips is meticulously calibrated in our laboratory using liquid standards of known value and the resultant calibration file is downloaded to the phone by scanning a QR code applied to each box of strips we sell. The user is able to make instant measurements in the field with no calibration required because we use the exact same LabStrip meters to calibrate and release product. We then feed the measurements from the LabStrip App to our cloud storage center, LabCloud, where it can be married with a host of other metadata for later data mining by the user. In addition to high-quality measurements, the iPhone 4 provides GPS location, date/time stamps, and the option to add annotations.",,,http://twitter.com/anywherescience,
