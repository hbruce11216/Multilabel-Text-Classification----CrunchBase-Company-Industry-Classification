There are many segments of the U.S. talent acquisition market. The market is growing in many segments including staffing firms, which are expected to achieve $125 billion in revenue in 2015. One of the largest growing segments in the talent acquisition market are the recruitment software providers, which will grow to $3 billion in 2015 with growth rates of 14.3% over the past 5 years. Market experts estimate that the U.S. represents approximately one-third of the world market and that the Global Talent Acquisition Market exceeds $400 billion (Market Line).    Digi-Me believes that all players in the talent acquisition market – whether employers or their software and service providers – will benefit from the use of video for employment advertising and employer branding. Because Digi-Me’s target customers and service providers are global themselves, and because its cloud-based technology platform is global and completely scalable as well, management believes Digi-Me is capable of addressing the global talent acquisition market.

We have amassed a roster of specialized independent talented Pros.  The moment that a client posts a shift, our system uses a sequence of algorithms to find a great match. Once one of our Pros accepts the shift, our clients can view their profile which, among other things, will contain their rating as ranked by clients and our staff, thus providing our clients a twice-vetted Pro. Filling a shift should not take hours. On HireApp, registering and posting a shift takes less than three minutes. Our clients set the time, duration, location, choose an hourly rate, and note any special requirements. Our AI technology immediately starts working to match them with a great fit. Because most temp agencies are still brick and mortar operations with lots of fixed costs and are using outdated technology, they are forced to charge and retain a premium for their service. This premium causes a large difference between what they charge and what they pay their workers.  At HireApp, our smart staff matching technology allows us to offer the same service at a lower cost to our clients.  This assures our clients that they are getting well-compensated and highly motivated workers. HireApp has no upfront or hidden costs for our clients or Pros.  Signing up and posting a shift is free. Our clients are charged only after a shift has been satisfactorily completed.  We specialize in the Moving, Warehousing, Construction, Cleaning, and Hospitality industries, and we are in the process of adding more categories.  Visit app.hireapp.me, sign-up for free, and be ready to take on your next project or shift.

MBI also provides technical consultation support to help teams that may need high-level experts to step in and provide technical review of the most critical projects. This allows our clients to get projects off the ground quicker. Almost all staffing companies claim the same differentiators and add value, but MBI truly is a different type of company in terms of the approach we take to ensuring we can meet the customer's very specific needs. The most profound differentiator is that MBI brings a group of highly technical staff to the very first meeting, not salesmen. We bring technical staff who listen to your plans/challenges, and we immediately save time on the search for the right professionals by asking a wide range of pertinent technical questions, and that is really due to the fact that our technical team's introductory visit is more than capable of both understanding the challenges associated to the most complex IT projects, as well as we can offer start up assistance if needed. Bringing the right people to the initial discussion, is hyper critical due to the fact that most IT teams are under intense pressure to deliver against very high expectations, and any steps taken to expedite the delivery of quality professionals is a step in the right direction. Above all, MBI wants any potential customer to sense both simplicity in how to get the process underway, and we want to reflect absolute professionalism in our ability to deliver quality IT resources.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/mbi-staffing-llc-,,https://www.twitter.com/mbistaffing,https://www.facebook.com/384346475030659,"490,784"
