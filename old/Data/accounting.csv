As a controller I was paired up with a GM to run the day to day operations of an auto mall with four franchises. Later as a CFO, the vice president and I ran the day to day operations of nine franchises in Chicago. During these seventeen years, I became involved in buy/sells, advertising, HR, bank relations, factory relations, legal, contracts and selling processes. During this time I would educate and train all department heads on the financial statement and forecasting. Due to the retirement of the dealer, I became the vice-president/GM of a single point Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram store. I was involved with the entire process of opening a new store. From getting factory approval, naming the store, website design and hiring all personnel. The dealer lived 1500 miles from store so I was the operator. While the VP, I learned the used car business by attending auctions and buying and selling vehicles, displaying vehicles on the lot and setting up a photo studio on the premise for high quality pictures. Additionally I spent most mornings on the service drive to improve service writer performance and customer satisfaction. Lastly I implemented a menu system in F&I that improved the dollars per unit by $250 and started a BDC. After about five years as the VP, I took on the largest challenge of my professional career. I moved across country to Las Vegas and became the GM of Towbin Dodge. During my first full year, 2013, I took them to the number one Dodge volume store in the country.

To plan future spending, you can create budgets, bill reminders and forecast your monthly cashflow.

Co-founder Ashwin Bharambe got the idea for Buxfer after becoming frustrated with the swarm of IOUs pasted up on his refrigerator while he was at Carnegie Mellon University working towards his PH.D.  Without a great way to track what he owed and what others owed him, Ashwin wrote a program to solve his problems that would eventually become social money website, Buxfer.   Buxfer allows its users to track their personal finances as well as regulate and organize loans and IOUs to friends.  It lets you keep totals of what you owe and what is owed to you, as well as divide bills.As an added bonus, users can log on to Buxfer using their Google, Yahoo, [Facebook](http://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook), AIM or Open ID logins to eliminate the account creation hassle.  Buxfer also displays your spending habits in the form of a pie chart with slices designated to categories like food, leisure, rent or whatever you want.

Expenses are broken down with charts, graphs, and tables. The website benefits independent travelers that desire a comprehensive breakdown of travel expenses. Travel expenses are entered by current travelers to categorize costs. This financial data is aggregated and used to develop average travel costs for other travelers estimating future expenses. Budget Your Trip is one of the first trip planning tools to use real time data provided by travelers to estimate costs and breakdown expenses on a detailed geographic and categorical level.  An upsurge in independent travel has created a demand for travel planning tools with accurate and current information. Independent travelers are scouring the web for approximate travel costs and web based tools to assist them with trip planning. The ""Gap Year"" or ""Travel Year"" concept, which began in Europe, has taken hold in the United States. Budget Your Trip meets the demands of this growing group by providing them with a tool to monitor their expenses, see their breakdown of spending, and predict future costs. The proliferation of internet availability in developing countries provides travelers with immediate access to technology and communication tools at an unprecedented level. Internet applications are now allowing travelers to stay in touch with friends and family via email, blogs, and social networks. Budget Your Trip builds on this trend by providing a budgeting tool and data gathering resource. Travelers can submit and monitor their own personal financial data from anywhere in the world. The Budget Your Trip expense tracking tool gathers data from an otherwise unmonitored group. Independent budget travelers typically use cash to purchase products and services from local businesses in foreign cities. Thus, much of their spending is not tracked or recorded by the travel industry. Budget Your Trip provides a means for the commercial travel industry to understand the spending habits of travelers that are not utilizing a travel agency, tour company, or industry specialist.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/budgetyourtrip,,http://twitter.com/budgetyourtrip,http://www.facebook.com/Budget-Your-Trip/295817989048,"219,560"

The Lab acts as a sounding board, listening to, analyzing and reflecting upon accountability concerns; as an independent interface, engaging relevant actors across contexts and issues; and as an operational hub, catalyzing innovative accountability tools and communities. Through this approach, the Lab bolsters efforts to address the causes rather than the symptoms of poverty, exclusion and insecurity. The Lab catalyzes tools for new and innovative approaches to bolster accountability.  The team:  i)	Listens to problems related to accountability, and analyzes core concerns within specific contexts through careful outreach. Too often, interventions are supply-driven and do not fit with on-the-ground needs and political-economy dynamics. ii)	Recognizes valuable accountability practices and builds partnerships to pilot new tools and validate fresh thinking, with an emphasis on learning from failure. In many cases, knowledge is not shared and experience is not sufficiently internalized.  iii)	Engages relevant actors and builds communities that can curate and propagate alternative ideas to allow for scale and impact. Collective solutions to shared issues of accountability are hindered when targeted support is not strategic, timely or durable. The Lab works with partners through three key channels: i)	Accountability Change Agency. A framework through which the Lab works with civil society groups to catalyze the development of new and innovative tools at the country-level, with a particular focus on youth.  ii)	@ccountability Initiative. A window through which the Lab supports new ideas at the intersection of accountability and technology through collaboration with ICT experts on the ground.  iii)	Accountapreneurship Funds. A support mechanism through which the Lab identifies and provides financial, networking and training support to “accountapreneurs” (individuals, groups or organizations that demonstrate an entrepreneurial approach to accountability issues). The Lab is registered as a 501(c)(3) status non-profit, tax exempt organization in the United States, based in the OpenGovHub. It is currently overseen by an independent, unpaid Board of Directors and supported through a voluntary “Brain Trust” of senior advisors around the world; and “Kitchen Cabinet” of close supporters.",,,http://twitter.com/accountlab,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Accountability-Lab/142205772542022,"325,954"
