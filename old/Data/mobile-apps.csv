Our model is different and it starts with our name: ABBY, an anagram for baby, refers to our first priority and FINN is an acronym for families in need. For too long, baby care and diapering has been approached the same way: the same old disposable diapers sold in stores, in pack sizes that don’t reflect usage. This model hasn’t been changed to reflect what today’s parents need : A convenient set-it-and-forget it approach to Baby Care that makes their busy lives easier; with high quality, design-oriented, earth-friendly products; and an opportunity for them to give to those in need with a purchase they are required to make.  Convenient.  You and your baby are at the core of our mission. We’re parents too; we know how busy life is and how little time you want to spend thinking about diapers. We’ve built the smartest, most flexible subscription model in the business. Our options enable you to choose the cadence that works for you, allows for multiple sizes within the same box, and enables a mix of our crowd-determined designs.  Conscientious.  We know how much your little one means to you, and that you want to make sure that any product touching their skin is gentle and effective (because blowouts happen!) We also understand how much you value the environment – you want it to be pristine for generations to come! For A&F, this means using the highest quality products that are gentler on the planet, with an eye for design.  Charitable.  Being a parent is one of the most universal experiences.

With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for? Let’s go on an adventure!",,,https://twitter.com/adventure_clubs,https://www.facebook.com/officialadventureclubs

That's a great question.  Now there's a great answer:  AnswerStage.   All you need is your phone to create videos that you can share anywhere -- your intranet, blog, email, LMS, CMS, customer support, or social networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.  Here's how it works:  1.  Think of questions that are pertinent to your audience. You type them in the way you'd like them to be presented.   2.  Record answers on your phone.  The AnswerStage app literally ""asks"" you questions using text-to-speech technology and you record your answer like you're having a video call.  It's that easy.  If you like your answer, just click save.  If you don't like your answer, just re-record it.  You get as many ""takes"" as you want.   3:  Add captions (if you want).  Your answers are automatically transcribed so you can add captions to your videos.  The AnswerStage app includes a simple while-you-watch tool for reviewing and editing captions so you can be sure that they're accurate and synchronized properly.  4: Use the AnswerStage Studio to combine your answers into an ""interview"" and pick a template for how you want the final video to look.  The options include animated introductions, titles, transitions and your contact information presented alongside of your answers.  All of the magic happens in the AnswerStage cloud-based production platform.  5. Share your video.  You're in complete control of where it gets distributed whether you just want to share it with friends, or colleagues, or post on social networks to maximize views.  Video is the new must-have for content creators and AnswerStage is best way to create videos that are helpful, interesting, timely and cost effective. And more importantly, AnswerStage leverages your most valuable asset -- your expertise and personality.   Features include: - enter and edit questions that you know are pertinent and helpful to your audience. - record answers anytime, anywhere. - re-record or do ""retakes"" of any answer. - keep an archive of answers to be used multiple times and combined in different ways for different audiences. - choose from dozens of templates, backgrounds, titles, and animations that make your video look great - add captions to your video with automatic transcriptions and an easy-to-use captions editor.  - choose to produce your video with just the audio of your answers with the ""radiowave"" template.  (Perfect for when there's bad lighting, distractions or just a bad hair day,) - Share to just the audience you want -- one-on-one with a prospect, with only people in your company, or with everyone in the world through services like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.",,,https://www.twitter.com/answerstage,

The Mobile Innovation Platform is called ""Innovation HQ"". 'IT' in 'Biz of IT' does not stand for Information Technology; it stands for ""Innovation & Transformation"". Bizofit's Open Innovation platform enables enterprises to discover and connect with startups on a ""globally curated"" platform. The platform also helps enterprises and startups to collaborate and build solutions. Via Bizofit / Innovation HQ platform, Enterprises post Innovation Challenges and Business Problems and crowdsource Ideas and Innovative solutions. Tech companies use the platform to reach CXOs and generate ""Digital"" Leads. The platform is designed to help Enterprise CXOs crowdsource Innovative Ideas and Solutions, and to operationalize Ideation and Innovation. Focus areas are Digital Technologies, but the Platform can be really used in any organization to seek and submit ideas / solutions.  Employees, ecosystem partners i.e. customers or vendors, or anyone can send you ideas and solutions, depending on your preferences. Every user is validated through his/her LinkedIn profile. The Technology companies on the Platform are curated, and Ideas and Solutions are vetted. Tech companies can use the Platform to generate Leads, if Enterprises are interested in their Ideas / Solutions. Several cool features like 'Like', Thumbs down, Forward and Replies are included. Some of the upcoming features include Rating of Ideas, and much more. Other features include the ability to Identify, Evaluate, and Select Technology Solutions through our proprietary 4P SUGAR Quadrant Framework. SUGAR stands for ""Specialized User Generated Aggregate Rating"". Only Customers and Analysts rate companies and solutions on the Platform. Bizofit was launched by IT Services industry veteran Bala Palamadai to disrupt the Technology space, by challenging the Status Quo – based on Legacy sourcing approaches, Legacy Service Providers and Legacy engagement models – that resulted in sub-optimal solutions, huge costs and limited adoption of Transformational solutions in several organizations. Identifying a new Technology vendor takes up to nine months – an unacceptably high time frame in today’s world. Also, a little-known fact is that new customer acquisition often costs as high as 20-30% of revenues for IT Service Providers, a cost which ultimately is borne by Enterprise Customers.  Through adoption of its Platform, Bizofit seeks to eliminate these inefficiencies and reduce costs, and most importantly present Enterprises with Transformational & Innovative Digital Solutions.

The web based application allows a business to make a coupon in minutes and then distribute it via email, print or on social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Unlike Groupon and the other daily deal sites, which keep up to 50% of the revenue of any ""deal"" offered by a merchant,  CashOff.com offers its coupon management system for as little as $10 per month without any revenue sharing whatsoever.   A recent report from Juniper Research suggests that the mobile coupon market will be worth $46 billion by 2015, a large jump from the $5.6 billion projected for the industry this year. In this day and age, consumers expect there to be deals when they go shopping, but most small businesses cannot afford the revenue sharing percentages the daily deal sites require and so they end up losing consumers to other companies that buy into the game.  Because of its low cost and marketing effectiveness, CashOff appeals to every business and has already started to go viral.  CashOff is currently offering a Free 12 Month Trial to its first 1,000 users.   The Company had a soft launch without formal announcement several days ago and the user sign ups have already far exceeded the Company's expectations.   “Within five days of going live, not only have small businesses across the country started to use our System, but we also signed up a restaurant that is part of a billion dollar national food chain,” according to Brian  Thomas, Founder, Chief Noise Maker and CEO. “30 years ago, I grew up in a family with so little money that if it were not for coupons I wouldn't be alive!   We think CashOff represents a game changer in the five billion dollar coupon space and we are excited to provide an affordable service that supports local economies.  My Mother Would be Proud of Me”.  About CashOff Inc.  CashOff is a cloud-based Coupon Management System that enables merchants to create and manage professional looking digital or mobile coupons with ease.  The CashOffs are the digital equivalent of traditional coupons but specifically designed to be used in emails, on websites and on social networks including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.

The platform is designed to connect the online world with the offline world: delivering the right information to the users in the right context (right time, right place, right intent). At the heart of the Clever Sense Platform is the Serendipity Engine: a personalized context-aware right-time discovery engine. The Serendipity Engine adds a layer of real-time machine learning algorithms and intelligent agent architecture on top of the Clever Sense Interest Graph. It goes beyond traditional recommendation engines by incorporating user's anonymous interest profile and current context (time, location, intent, and social context) into curation of its recommendations. The Alfred mobile app is a personal concierge who provides high-quality recommendations from the start. Coming soon for iOS devices, Alfred recommends places that will truly shine for users, based on what he learns about their personal tastes and his extensive knowledge from the general web. Alfred, who has been called ""Pandora for the real world"", provides increasingly fine-tuned suggestions, personalized to the location, time, and person. Clever Sense was founded by two Stanford Engineering graduates in 2008. Our technical advisory includes Prof. Jeff Ullman (Sergey Brin's former advisor at Stanford) and Sep Kamvar (creator of Google's Personalized Search).",,,,

Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/connected-signals-inc-,,https://twitter.com/ConnectedSigs,https://www.facebook.com/Connected-Signals-152962808055458/

THE BEGINNING Crossfield began as a mobile gaming start-up called PrePlay, which developed web and mobile applications that enabled sports fans to make predictions about every play of every game.   PrePlay was the #1 live sports prediction game from 2010-2015 and spanned across professional baseball, football, hockey and tennis.  Over that time, our users made over 50 million predictions across all of our applications. JOINING A NEW TEAM PrePlay was acquired by FanVision Entertainment (FVE) in September of 2014.  FVE added PrePlay’s management and software expertise to further deliver on its mission to enhance the spectator experience. THE TRANSITION FanVision Entertainment is one of a portfolio of companies within the Related Sports and Entertainment (RSE) Ventures family of companies.  When sister company Relevent Sports, the operators of the International Champions Cup, called us about developing their new website, the transition from mobile gaming experts to work-for-hire software development agency began. A NEW NAME After launching the International Champions Cup site and signing Bleacher Report as a partner for its March Madness Bracket Challenge Game, we set out to rebrand the agency to reflect our broader range of capabilities.   Prediction gaming (including live prediction, bracket and streak games) remains a core competency, but we built a team that has decades of combined creative, development and digital strategy experience that spans far beyond gaming.  PrePlay as a self-published product was shut down, and Crossfield Digital, the agency, was born in October of 2015.",https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10256789/,,https://twitter.com/crxssfield,https://www.facebook.com/pg/CrossfieldDigital/

In the same way Uber facilitates on-demand ride services, Fresh Direct on-demand groceries, and Netflix on-demand movies, ImaSpanse helps people find the world's biggest commodity: other people. Facebook and Meetup services force users to plan weeks, days, and hours before an event begins. ImaSpanse knows that planning is not in style anymore. People need to study now. They need to sell concert tickets now. They need to eat now. ImaSpanse shows people who and what is nearby, and gives them the tools to connect and make it happen.    While users are finding businesses through ImaSpanse, businesses are able to reach out to their consumers. Business discovery services like Yelp are static: businesses have no say in their image. But ImaSpanse moves with a business. It allows them to not only be on the go, but send location-based push marketing notifications directly to their customers phones. Today these services are primarily housed in third party apps. This requires a customer to download each corporation’s app (Starbucks, Dunkin Doughnuts, CVS, Walgreens...) cluttering phones. Most small businesses don't have and frankly don't want an app, but they would love to send their customers notifications. ImaSpanse provides access to this service as painlessly as Square gives small businesses access to accepting credit card payments.     ImaSpanse is quick, fast, and the answer to the next trend on the horizon: on-demand meeting. They make it as easy as calling an Uber, and as fun as curling up with a movie on Netflix, and as simple as swiping right on Tinder.",,,https://twitter.com/ImaSpanse,https://www.facebook.com/pages/ImaSpanse/682240821901419
