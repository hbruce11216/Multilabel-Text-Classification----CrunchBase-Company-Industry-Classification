Mentor Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mentor-capital,http://mentorcapital.com,"Banking, Cannabis, Finance","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Lending and Investments",Public Market Funding for Cannabis.,"Mentor Capital, Inc. (MNTR) is a public company that invests in medical and social use cannabis companies. Mentor takes a 10% to 100% position in the various members of our family of participating companies, but leaves operating control firmly in the hands of the cannabis company founders. Because adult social use and medical marijuana opportunities often overlap, Mentor Capital participates in the legal recreational marijuana market. However, Mentor’s preferred focus is medical and the company seeks to facilitate the application of cannabis to cancer wasting, calming seizures, Parkinson’s disease, reducing ocular pressures from glaucoma and blunting chronic pain. Mentor’s approach and capital structure allows its shareholders to buy an additional $140 million of Mentor shares at approximately a 12.5% discount. As money is sent in to buy into the growing cannabis portfolio, the proceeds are split pro rata amongst the cannabis companies that are participating in the indirect sale. As more private cannabis companies join in the consortium, the MNTR share price is pushed higher, other things being equal. The increasing share price may well increase the exercise of stock options and warrants by both Mentor Capital’s 1,500 mostly accredited shareholders and the public market in general. Using this approach, Mentor seeks to deliver a higher price to founders for a smaller slice of their business. Retaining control and receiving more cash are the two key advantages to cannabis founders working with Mentor Capital, Inc. Mentor Capital migrated to the cannabis space from leading-edge cancer investments when government actions collapsed the new leading cancer sector (e.g. Dendreon, the market leader, dropped from $44 per share to $2.90 per share.) Mentor still retains some cancer investments, but will complete the shift to the cannabis marketplace as profitable opportunities to exit present themselves. Originally, Mentor Capital was formed in Silicon Valley in 1985 with $1,000 by current CEO, Chet Billingsley. The company completed dozens of early private acquisitions and went public in 1995. Mentor Capital feels there is significant opportunity to approach the medical marijuana market as a business-focused, high-integrity, public company providing significantly more financing to private cannabis companies. As a result, Mentor will be able to return increasing stock value to the investing public. As a distinct first step in this direction, the Mentor CEO has placed his shares in escrow with a law firm to obviate the risk of pump and dump activity that has otherwise been associated by regulators with other public marijuana related firms. Cannabis related firms seeking a larger amount of long-term cooperative financing, for a smaller slice of their business, are encouraged to contact Mentor Capital to discuss reserving their pro rata portion of Mentor’s $140 million authorized raise.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/mentor-capital-inc-mntr-,,,,"50,909"

BitPlus Hosting (BPH) BPH will offer the only known Single-Phase Liquid Immersion Cooling (SLIC) hosting solution available in North America providing its Cryptomining and Data Center customers a competitive advantage through increased equipment efficiencies. The use of immersion cooling, over time we believe it will render current air-cooled technology obsolete.  In providing greater efficiency to our hosted clients BPH experiences superior client retention and will establish itself as an industry leader in both quality and quantity of clients served, both in Cryptomining and Data. In preparation to capitalize on our power build out, BitPlus Hosting intends to acquire current cryptomining hosting and mining companies and convert them to immersion at their facilities or consolidate their operations to our facilities with extremely low electricity costs.  An added benefit to BPH is that profitability in our own mining operations will be superior to traditional mining and hosting companies, see “BitPlus Capital” below.  Our internal mining expertise is magnified with superior low-cost electricity rates. We produce our own electricity, with our own equipment, from surplus natural gas at rates under $0.03/kWh by way of our owned company, Global Northern Resources, LLC.

Low cost power acquisition is a cornerstone for GNR’s immediate and long-term growth.  Our short-term objective will be to produce 250 MW of electricity by year-end 2021, 500 MW of electricity by year-end 2022 and 1,000MW of electricity by year-end 2024.  We currently have 40MW completed in Colorado Springs, CO with an additional 50MW ready for build out.  In Grand Forks, ND we have 30MW completed with an additional 100MW site identified and in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada we have 58MW available for acquisition.

Our team of computer scientists have vast experience developing the microchips currently used in the most efficient miners available today.

Brink's was founded in Chicago on May 5, 1859 when Perry Brink purchased a horse-drawn wagon and made his first delivery. The wagon bore his new company's name – Brink's City Express. Chicago was booming, fueled by new railroads built to exploit the growing economy of the surrounding Midwestern U.S. With railroads came manufacturers, distributors, banks and insurance companies, all of whom attracted business travelers to the new city. In the early days, Brink used his single wagon to transport travelers' luggage between Chicago rail stations and hotels. In 1860, Brink's employees delivered luggage and parcels during the Republican National Convention, where an estimated 50,000 delegates and spectators assembled to see local dark-horse candidate Abraham Lincoln win the nomination over other contenders. In 1871, the Great Chicago fire destroyed some 18,000 buildings, including the headquarters of Brink's City Express. Miraculously, Brink's horses and wagons were saved and the company was back in operation within a week. As Chicago recovered, Brink's grew. By 1872, Brink's ran 20 wagons to every part of the city three times a day and had begun service to the prosperous new suburbs. The company advertised fees less than those of competitors: 25 cents to deliver a trunk from a train station to anywhere in the city.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/brinks,,https://twitter.com/Brinks,https://www.facebook.com/brinks,"120,141"

Why? Because ""the bank across town"" set the price benchmark artificially low, knowing they’d get bailed out if a loan went bad. In 2006, many bank CEOs would routinely tell us ""we just can't get paid for risk."" Today, we never hear this. Without rising asset values to lean on, the success of community banks depends almost entirely on their ability to compete for the best deals, protect and strengthen their relationships, and price appropriately for risk. Banks that aren’t able to refocus on these things stand to lose everything. We believe that the most important conversation a lender has with a borrower is about pricing.

Antilles' specialty is in identifying investment opportunities in India that are grossly under-priced (with respect to its value) or because of some structural market issues and invest in these opportunities for a 5-year period. Due to our unique legal structure of investments, Investors can make very high returns (in the range of 30%+ p.a.) and receive these returns tax-free in the USA. Current Investment opportunities include various companies in diverse sectors (e.g. Infrastructure, consumption/ FMCG, E-Commerce/ Technology) that have the potential to generate high returns over the next 3-5 year period. The Principal in Antilles Advisors has very deep business and commercial relationships in India that allow him to discover and invest in these opportunities before the broader market discovers these opportunities. One of the most promising investment opportunities include an Utility firm that is trading at US$ 40 million market cap, when the company has assets worth US$ 2 billion. We strongly believe that there are several such opportunities that are severely under-priced in India and that will provide huge returns to investors in the near future.",,,,,"139,881"
