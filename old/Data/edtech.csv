We are in the early growth stages of taking our product to market and are hiring.  LRM is a new category of product that fills a major void in the education technology market by helping organizations to organize complex learning relationships and ensure that all learners benefit from them.  Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems are essential to execute the transactions of modern education and they drive efficiency and standardization. But they do so at the expense of relationships.  And we think that relationships are absolutely essential to learning. People are motivated to learn because the content is related to their long term goals. They learn in context of their relationships with peers, teachers, mentors, and a community of other learners. They learn because they want to progress and form relationships with companies and societies that require expertise and credentials.  If you analyze the most pernicious problems in education from the skills gap to attrition to professional development, you’ll find inadequate learning relationships to be at the root cause of everything.  Most learning organizations understand this and are trying to fill that relationship void with Customer Relationship Management software. But CRM is designed for sales and is insufficient to the task of managing learning relationships because CRMs treat the contact as a passive participant to be acted upon by sales people. Fidelis’ LRM recognizes that learners have to be active drivers of their own success and provides them a beautiful way to organize the relationships that they need to succeed.  Given how important learning is to every organization, to society, and to democracy, we think that someone is going to build a multi-billion dollar company selling LRMs - we hope it's us.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/fidelis-inc/,,https://twitter.com/fidelised,,"25,964"

Current travel-tracking solutions are antiquated and ineffective. To the extent a school has the foresight and maturity to offer products and services like emergency contact cards or check-in apps, students are overwhelmingly unaware or disengaged. The schools own the risk but are flying blind. In fact, nearly 70% of students did not report their side-trips and/or their independent off-campus travel while on school-sponsored programs. The information gap is bad for everyone. Students need safety and security services, but don’t voluntarily adopt them, even when available or made mandatory. Social connections, adventure, and budget drive student travel behaviors. Safety and security are after-thoughts or “no-thoughts”—third on their totem pole of travel anxieties. When something goes wrong, the school is exposed not only to incident-related loss and expense, but disproportionate harm to reputation, and to strategic objectives to promote wide use of study abroad options.  For this reason, we created OffWeGo, a student-centric, mobile-first solution equally valuable and appealing to university risk managers and student travelers. We streamline the data collection of student travel by bundling key safety features from our travel assistance partners, with social and monetary incentives that keep students engaged and an active participant in the reporting process. We send this data to the student's university to aid the university's duty of care, so they can properly advise and assist the travelers once they've departed.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/offwego-llc/,,https://twitter.com/offwegotrips,https://www.facebook.com/offwego.io/,"56,478"

So, we started investigating where all these jobs are. It turned out, most of the companies in Vermont are small, as in less than 10 employees.

They do need help executing marketing strategies, making graphics, and communicating with customers, but they can’t afford that for 30 hours a week.

Building a better child care economy.,"Provide helps entrepreneurs build stronger childcare businesses. We do this through a software-based back office that automates child care providers’ government-facing administrative work. Today, providers face complex regulatory burdens that lead to thousands of dollars of lost income and hundreds of hours spent on administration annually. These problems are more acute for providers who serve low-income families who pay with government subsidies.    Provide helps child care providers increase their incomes and spend less time on administration. It also reduces the risk of accepting government subsidies, enabling providers to serve the families who need them most. Our service includes three core verticals: (1) assistance claiming public funding; (2) licensing and compliance support; and (3) expense tracking to maximize tax deductions. As we grow, Provide will also connect child care providers to ongoing political work to help them advocate for a streamlined system of fully-funded early childhood education. Provide is the winner of the 2017 Social New Venture Challenge and a member of the 2017 Polsky Summer Accelerator cohort. Provide was also recognized as one of Chicago Inno's 2017 50 on Fire.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/22292376/,,https://twitter.com/ProvideCareUSA,https://www.facebook.com/ProvideCareUSA/,"174,622"

The 6-month pilot has informed the strategy for refining the product and scaling iCreate as a differentiator in prioritizing learning over technology use. The learning tool that is currently at the core of iCreate's offerings is a stop-motion animation application designed to give students a unique medium of representing their ideas and developing understandings in science.  A limited feature free version of the product, known as SAM Animation, has attracted over 30,000 free download users in just 2 years. iCreate owns the exclusive license for SAM Animation, which is copyrighted and trademarked by Tufts University.  Because the product has been in development for a number of years with real classroom testing, the software provides an intuitive, simple interface for students to physically build scenes on their desks with basic craft materials, and snap sequential still images of these scenes via a webcam in real-time, facilitating the creation of a stop-motion animated film or digital flipbook.  These animated films give teachers a quick opportunity to assess students' conceptual understandings, and becomes a powerful tool on not just a learning level, but also a teaching level. iCreate is scaling to offer student users of the software the ability to upload their creations directly to a free web community, where other educators can view how students have been able to apply the tool.  While there are free options for both the application and the community, teachers and schools may pay for upgrades to the software, receiving more editing options, as well as upgrades to the community, receiving standards-based activity modules.

Outside of standard subjects like math and reading, students take 2 technology classes per day, learning everything from mobile app development to project management.

We have taught thousands of students in over 40 countries across the globe to learn to trade Mirroring the growth of the entire industry, Trading Advantage has evolved from its roots to the Trading floor. Larry Levin, founding partner and president, has deep ties to the trading floor as he began as a runner at the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the early 1990s.  Larry quickly climbed the ranks from phone clerk to desk manager to eventually trading his own account. At the height of his trading career, Larry averaged between 2500-3000 S&P contracts per day to become both a profitable and respected trader in the E-mini S&P 500 futures pit. From his years of experience on the trading floor, Larry recognized that successful trading over the long haul requires a sound strategy and a specific plan. Sensing the inevitable shift away from the open outcry pits to an electronic marketplace, Larry founded Trading Advantage to share the secrets of his success with a larger audience. He partnered with Josh Lewis in 1998 and they are joint owners of the company.. Now a nationally recognized media figure, Larry has been interviewed hundreds of times on virtually every major financial media outlet including CNBC, Bloomberg TV, and Fox Business News. Over recent years, Trading Advantage has grown to a full-fledged investment school with a staff of 40 plus dedicated industry leaders. We are committed to being both technological and educational innovators as we continue to refine, improve and update our infrastructure and educational materials. We have partnered with industry leaders who are at the technology forefront including Lightspeed VT , ESIgnal and Bluewater Trading Technology. Trading Advantage has kept pace with the evolution of the financial industry by empowering and educating the individual investor so they can compete in the new technological paradigm. The historical models which had the individual investor being heavily reliant on a financial planner, a stock broker or a banker to both control and execute their investment decisions have dramatically changed. Technological advances and the evolution of a global and more open marketplace make it easier for the individual investor to control their financial future. Trading Advantage has honed in on this demand by providing education solutions so students can effectively learn to take control of their investment portfolios.   We are committed to delivering innovative solutions to our student base via virtual classroom learning environments and one on one educational experiences delivered through state of the art technology.

Academic Room,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/academic-room,http://www.academicroom.com,"EdTech, Education","Education, Software",Academic Room is an online marketplace to curate scholarly content from journal articles to course lectures.,"Academic Room (http://www.academicroom.com) is the first multidisciplinary knowledge platform where you can build open communities to organize academic content within well-defined practice areas—ranging from philosophy, history and economics to engineering, architecture and medicine. The platform also dramatically reduces time to locate, both, credible scholarship and experts within a field of research. Academic Room was a finalist in 2012 Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) Awards and 2013 EdTech Digest Awards Program for its ability to harness and broker resources and talent across its open communities. Academic Room is headquartered in the Harvard Innovation Lab. Access to educational knowledge, along with the process of its discovery, is an intractable problem, resulting in 3.7 billion related searches every month. ""Researchers—be they senior scholars or freshmen—no longer make the library the first stop in their search for knowledge. The shift from producing and consuming information in hard copy to multimedia digital form has moved the center of information gravity from research libraries to the Internet."" Search engine algorithms rank content that has gone through search engine optimization (SEO) making it more difficult to find more specific high quality academic content. To make matters worse, academic content is becoming increasingly complex and varied, posing an enormous challenge to organize it within traditional web portals. Given these limitations, not surprisingly, the delivery of content occurs haphazardly through disparate websites that often have little to do with education. For instance, today’s students and professors must scour library catalogs for books; video sites for lectures; journal databases for articles and reviews; job boards for career opportunities; and search engines for content such as bibliographies, data sets, lecture notes, syllabi and past exams. As research increasingly becomes interdisciplinary, there is a pressing need for a platform that is social and facilitates both permanent curation and discovery of knowledge. Academic Room’s knowledge management capabilities bring order to this chaos by providing the technology and semantic framework to organize content—in all its complexity—into well-defined subject areas. Because raw and published content is no longer scattered, but rather curated in one central location within specialized social communities on the platform, there emerge a number of opportunities to build a meaningful ecosystem of services around academic disciplines. For instance, Columbia University's Center for Development Economics and Policy (CDEP) uses Academic Room to curate working papers, journal articles and events for its global audience of thought leaders. CDEP also runs a multi-author blog on Academic Room.  Similarly, faculty from Harvard University use Academic Room to engage with industry and announce new projects. Academic Room provides single-search discovery of relevant content in all formats (article, book, review, video, audio, image, bibliography, syllabus, dissertation, manuscript) to granular levels. By adding a social networking layer to the platform, content producers and consumers—whether institutions or individuals—are able to create their profiles, dynamically update content they have authored, and engage with other users in discussion groups and blogs. Academic Room was conceived as a content platform with the larger vision of collaboration in mind from its very inception because other existing solutions are mere social networks that lack the capability to create structured repositories of knowledge.",,,http://twitter.com/academicroom,http://www.facebook.com/academicroom,"317,312"

This should be a time every teenager looks forward to without any worry of violence or crime because they are being attentively protected for the case of extreme danger. Right now, that isn’t entirely true.” - Sean Levinson, Elite Daily, April 11, 2013 Never-Before-Offered, In-The-Moment, Mobile Conflict Resolution & Mediation Caroami is an online conflict resolution and mediation platform operated through a messaging interface. It uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and Machine Learning to resolve conflicts in-the-moment, before they escalate, such as roommate disputes, dating issues, ghosted friendships, unfriended pals, gender politics, and sexual harassment. The millennial market looks for an instant, mobile, and electronic solution to conflict.  $2.9B Market Opportunity Higher education institutions are in turmoil, and Caroami is ready to step in to help at this pivotal time with our unique offering. The college experience has always been demanding, and students face a range of interpersonal problems that determine their success or failure. Add to that the effect mobile and social technology has had on the social skills of students entering college in recent years leaving them without adequate negotiating or communication skills to resolve disputes. Even though 98% of the 83.1M Millenials in the US use a smartphone, there is no digital tool on the market that provides an instant, mobile, or confidential way to help them resolve interpersonal conflict. Traditional, off-line mediation solutions are time-intensive, cumbersome, and extremely costly. In addition to higher education, Caroami is poised to serve corporate users, HOAs, courts, government, and the military with a market potential of $2.9B and growing. The future of conflict resolution is digital, instantaneous, and mobile, and is currently not being adequately served. Workplace discrimination against employees based on race, gender, or sexual orientation costs businesses an estimated $64 billion annually, not including the cost to their reputation or workplace morale. When companies buy harassment insurance, they are not protecting the victims. Caroami protects both the end user and the organization. Value Proposition From frazzled to happy, students can now use Caroami to resolve their roommate disputes, gender politics, sexual harassment, and other issues at the moment with our messaging interface-based mobile which replaces the slow, inadequate, and rather public Facebook and Twitter apps they are currently using for this purpose. Colleges, universities, and other organizations can avoid costly settlements, expensive lawyers, and hits to their reputations with the help of our app that affordably uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and ML to guide students to de-escalate potential violence and restore relationships that have gone awry. It also has applications in cases of gender, religion, and identity politics that pose legal, PR nightmares, and attrition, all while keeping problems internal to the organization.  Happy students turn into happy alumni and future donors. Paying clients will receive data/analytics to better plan next academic year. Employers can identify and prevent problems way before they escalate. Students will learn to resolve conflicts over time, promote wellness, and preserve friendships.
