We reward their confidence in us by constantly improving production efficiency to produce ethanol above the official nameplate rating for this plant. In fact, ours is a culture of continuous improvement as we seek to improve everything we do. Construction on the original 15-million-gallon ethanol plant in Stanley began in 2001. During that run-up to full operation, a CO2 plant was built in order to add CO2 and dry ice as co-products. Before long, customers signaled the need for additional capacity, so by 2004 the plant expanded to create 30 million gallons of ethanol yearly. Establishing a second grain-receiving location called Four Corners in 2005 expanded our connection to farmers in our region. Two years later, Four Corners had grown to include 1.3 million bushels of corn storage, enhancing our ability to secure corn needed to maintain a round-the-clock production system. Ace Ethanol acquired all Utica Energy facilities in the Oshkosh and Green Bay area in 2013, infusing our operation with new dedication for efficiency, capacity, and top-quality products. Those locations are wholly owned subsidiaries of Ace Ethanol, LLC. Our Members and a Member Board of Directors include farmers and local investors who understand the value of a local grain marketing opportunity that results from renewable energy.

PALM™ is more sophisticated than anything used in the petroleum industry today. For example, PALM™ predictive and optimization technologies use proprietary time-series shape recognition and real-time decision trees to automatically steer fracs to classifications that we invented, the combination of which over 10’s of stages, is statistically more likely to produce high volumes of hydrocarbons and eliminate low producers, saving millions in operational costs, all in real-time. AKW’s value proposition was developed and tested in a prime ultra-rich wet gas shale play with a best-practices independent oil and gas company in the United States. Profitability increases across the life of each well using PALM™ were estimated to vary from 35% in wet gas wells to 50% in NGL wells.

Alion specifically designed a more efficient construction process for utility scale solar plants by using robotic installation technology and established construction industry practices.   Now, Alion Energy builds utility scale systems twice as fast and with less than half the labor.   At Alion Energy, we go beyond simply building the most cost-effective utility scale solar systems; we build solar plants with LCOEs that can compete with any generation source.",,,,

It is the only Nano-scale, on-site production of LNG in the world.     Birthed in Silicon Valley, AG&T believes liquid natural gas (LNG) is the alternative transition fuel of the future. As long as they continue to use the combustion engine LNG is the simplest hydrocarbon they have and the cleanest fossil fuel in existence. It's non-toxic, it's safe to breath, it does not affect water quality and it’s safe for sea life. If spilled it does not leave a residue, it evaporates quickly, when mixed with air it becomes to lean to burn and simply vaporizes. At current commodity price levels it costs less than 60 cents a gallon. In North America they have over a 100-year supply of natural gas, enough that it would allow us to become completely independent upon foreign oil. The real question maybe, why aren't they using it now?    Zeus Intelligence reports there are only 29 LNG manufacturing plants in the U.S. today and DOE reports only 81 fueling stations. The average plant produces over 100,000 gallons per day. What makes AG&T unique is their ability to manufacture under 2,000 gallons a day. At this """"Nano-scale"""" AG&T liquefiers fall under the higher regulatory burdens of larger plants and by occupying such a small foot print AG&T liquefiers are portable and can easily be placed in a fleet operators parking lot. After tapping into the local utilities natural gas lines, AG&T can be produced LNG on-site for use as an alternative fuel for cars and trucks.    In the battle to fight global warming and climate change, AG&T liquefiers are also a perfect fit for solving the worlds air pollution problems stemming from fugitive gases coming from oil & gas drilling sites as well as public landfills.

We strip out the methane/ethane for on site generator fuel, move the remaining chemicals (NGL's) to tanks and transport the material. NGL's sell or $1 gallon approx. Generators onsite provide power for the oil well and processor, onsite diesel generators are removed. The NGL's pay for the cost of the system that can be leased or purchased. On larger wells the profits on the NGL's can be significant.    Complete mobile system, including redundant generators. processor, tanks, platforms, buildings, cabling etc. competitors only provide partial. System utilizes a patented non-refrigeration, non-JT, non-cryo system, does not use glycol or methanol. Results in higher NGL yields, larger turn-down range, higher quality methane fuel and lower system costs.    Systems generate power and host a patented LNG output module to create LNG or CNG from unused methane in addition to NGL monetization. Near zero emissions possible today.    Our systems are tailored to the well volume and power needs. Systems are duel fueled and redundant so that oil pumping can proceed virtually 100% of the time with little or no downtime. These system work at -40F so they can operate in remote heavy snow areas, on rough terrain and more.

Anellotech is developing an efficient and eco-friendly thermal catalytic process for converting non-food biomass into aromatics. These bio-based products, chemically identical to petroleum-based aromatics, are used to make important plastics such as polyester (polyethylene terephthalate or “PET”), polystyrenes, polycarbonates, nylons and polyurethanes that ultimately are transformed into consumer goods such as beverage bottles, food packaging, clothing, footwear, carpeting, automotive and electronic components, and more. Anellotech's ultimate competitive advantage is its use of a one-reactor catalytic process. Also, by using renewable and readily available non-food inputs, such as wood, corn stover and bagasse, the Bio-TCat™ process is less expensive than to processes relying on sugar as a feedstock, and avoids competition with the food chain. As a result, these renewable-sourced chemicals are expected to be produced and sold profitably against identical, petroleum-derived BTX counterparts.

Kelldorf,  the founder, has spent over thirty years working as a petroleum geologist. In 1985, the value of Arkoma’s proprietary technical database of geologic and engineering information would naturally result in the pioneering of their first private mineral acquisition program. The innovative low to medium risk investment program was established to capitalize on the existing opportunities in the Mid-Continent Region of the United States to purchase mineral, royalty and working interests. Arkoma’s guiding principle of selectively purchasing minerals and royalties through a high graded methodology enabled Arkoma to continue its involvement in the Arkoma Basin on behalf of several institutional clients who were risk adverse to oil and gas investments. Some of Arkoma’s institutional investors have included Stanford University Endowment, Austin College Endowment and JP Morgan Chase Bank (Mercantile Bank Trust). In 1995, Arkoma transitioned into becoming its own client, retaining 100% of all producing reserves purchased through Arkoma’s in-house team of managers, geologists, engineers, landmen and business professionals. Profile: Arkoma Companies is a privately held group of companies based in Rockwall, Texas that is comprised of fourteen individual entities engaged in a number of business activities including real estate and energy. For over thirty years, this conglomerate of companies has been primarily engaged in oil and gas development through the acquisition of minerals, royalties and working interests in the United States. Arkoma has been able to successfully capitalize its intellectual know-how through wisely investing, owning and operating a number of businesses engaged in asset management that offer low to medium risk investment alternatives exclusively to high net worth individuals and institutional investors. Expertise: Arkoma’s technical staff has an excess of thirty years experience using unique proprietary technical data which includes production history, geological studies and reserve estimates for every field where the group has acquired minerals. This information, combined with excellence in investing, enables Arkoma to continue to be a pioneer in the energy industry. Arkoma’s turnkey approach combines both science and finance creating a business model like no other. For more than thirty years the group has successfully leveraged its core assets, which is the technical information capable of translating useful knowledge for decision-making and business innovation that is effectively applied to capitalize on investment opportunities. Arkoma Companies employs elite geologists, engineers and business professionals that are at the forefront of technical developments and investment strategies within the energy industry. The company’s research and engineering operations reflect a commitment to directly contribute to the development of the future in oil and gas innovation.

As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods.  Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).",https://www.linkedin.com/company/armita-x,,,https://www.facebook.com/Armita-X-178962392726604/

The 2.5 MW CycWEC Levelized Cost of Energy is  $0.13 per kWh.    Building on many of the principles and technologies of the wind turbine industry, like the wind turbine industry from the 1980's through 2000, the CycWEC will see a 2 to 3 times further reduction in LCOE when deployed in volume. The CycWEC utilizes a patented wave terminator generator design combined with the proprietary real-time control and optimization of underwater hydrofoils to archive this high wave-to-wire energy conversion.  It is the only ocean wave energy converter that cost effectively scales in size and power output. Leveraging $3.5 million in non-dilutive US Department of Energy funding with an on-going seed-stage round, Atargis  is on-track for 1/15 scale testing in 2021 and 1/4 ocean-testing in 2023/early 2024, and full scale ocean trials 2025.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/atargis-energy-corp-/,,,https://www.facebook.com/Atargis/

Avion Energy takes advantage of this opportunity to provide exceptional energy procurement service which finds the best price for the consumer and simplifies energy decisions. In similar fashion to how the insurance, banking, and travel industries were affected by companies like Progressive in 1995, Expedia and Travelocity in 1996, and LendingTree in 1998, Avion Energy seeks to change the dynamic of how energy is procured.  Typically a consumer will contact two or three energy providers and select the one that is currently offering a low, “teaser” rate.  After the introductory offer ends, the rate will increase at a slow but steady pace as energy providers are aware that many consumers rarely reevaluate or change energy providers.  That means the energy provider’s rate steadily increases; or better put, the consumer’s energy bill steadily rises for years.  Avion Energy assists the consumer in an extensive review of applicable energy providers year after year, thereby finding and keeping the consumer in best pricing.   Avion Energy has spent the past five years creating a proof-of-concept system to provide an apple-to-apples comparison of energy rates in all deregulated markets at no direct charge to the consumer.  This proprietary technology places Avion Energy in the forefront of energy procurement.   Avion Energy generates revenue every time one of its clients, an energy consumer, pays his/her electricity and/or natural gas bill.  The client never pays Avion Energy directly.  As is the case with many types of brokers, the seller pays a broker fee or commission.  In the case of energy procurement, the energy provider pays the energy broker based on the usage of the client.",,,,

The Company has three products scheduled for production: •The SunDuo™ T16 is a roof or ground mounted solar/thermal system with low cost combined heat and power. •The SunDuo™ G16 is a ground-mounted solar/thermal system for uneven terrain ideal for off-grid applications. •The SunTrio™ combines either the T16 or the G16 with a desalination system built to Beltane’s specification and private label manufactured for distribution. SunDuo™ creates electricity and hot water from a solar photovoltaic and thermal receiver. Reflectors concentrate sunlight, reducing the PV cells required by 93%. The receiver captures the valuable thermal energy produced by cooling PV cells so they operate more efficiently. The thermal energy is used by C&I CHP customers to offset the cost of their water heating requirements. Integrated tracking collects 30-40% more energy throughout the day and collects 60-100% more energy during peak utility demand charge periods in the late afternoon. We have determined that the scalable SunDuo™ has the lowest levelized cost of electricity in its market and the highest IRR in its class. SunTrio™ systems are designed for the distributed desalination market for the production of agricultural, industrial and drinking water. It provides a scalable distributed solution combining SunDuo™ collectors with proven, private labeled desalination systems. The point-of-use system is deployable in underserved areas that have extensive brackish water resources. Unlike brick-and-mortar facilities, the SunTrio™ does not require infrastructure and pipelines. The cost of water produced by a fossil fuel dependent desalination plant will increase with inflation but a solar powered system fixes energy costs over a 20 plus year period in locations without affordable energy or a grid. The SunTrio™ is designed to be installed in a short period of time with minimal or no permitting and can be redeployed elsewhere.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/2260025,,https://www.twitter.com/beltanesolar,https://www.facebook.com/beltanesolar

The result of neglected and aging grid infrastructure, our founder sought a way to circumvent the grid altogether. He applied his 30+ years of experience in electric motor and battery technology to develop a compact yet robust microgrid system—a system that enables residential and commercial consumers alike to become grid independent and maximize the ROI on their solar, wind and hydro energy investments.  Personal experience and extensive research have led us to the conclusion that the prevailing battery backup solutions on the market are not cutting it. These sub-15 kWh systems provide little more than half-a-days power to the average American home, which consumes 30 kWh/day. Something more is needed. Like most people, our founder knew that he would never possess the massive solar arrays and battery storage to make sustainable living possible. He also personally felt the expense burden of generators and energy storage devices that cost him thousands of dollars up front, and thousands more in fuel and energy rationing down the road. With a breached pain threshold, he set out to make a change.  That change was Blue Power Systems. Offering a patent-pending, state-of-the-art hybrid microgrid system, BPS provides users a new solution—a self-sufficient unit that supports the average American home without energy rationing and without exorbitant fuel costs. The system keeps users energy independent by relying on multiple energy sources: renewable energy (such as solar, wind or hydro), grid energy (if available/whenever it’s cheap), and also generator energy (which charges the system batteries directly). Grid down? Use your generator and solar. Solar panels not working? Use your wind turbine and grid charge. Alternatives make our product practical.  Blue Power Systems is unique because of our hybrid approach, efficient generator system, and greater battery capacity. Typical generators run 24 hours (27.5 gallons/day) to power a home, releasing energy that may or may not get used while constantly emitting harmful gasses and particulate matter. Blue Power Systems runs its generator for 2.5 hours (2.875 gallons/day) to accomplish the same job; that’s 90% less fuel, 90% less pollution.  Further, our units include a revolutionary BLADE exhaust filter that are lab-proven to reduce PM 2.5 by 72% as well as Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by 12%––meaning that our already efficient generation system has even more environmental protections in place. To top it off, 64 decibels at 20 feet make us quieter than a standard AC unit. An intuitive system control center enables users to customize their needs: renewable energy priority, cost priority, etc. The intelligent algorithms present both immediate and predictive data to the user via an elegant mobile phone app, which also displays real-time data collection concerning energy storage/usage/production.  People are beginning to look elsewhere as centralized power continues to falter.

Since the Chinese Government’s “war on pollution” declaration in March, 2014, coal use in China is increasingly restricted. Today Chinese groups seek alternative sources of methanol from overseas. Several groups plan to make large investments outside of China in methanol plants to control supply costs rather than buy """"retail"""" priced methanol from large, foreign owned companies. Also, Chinese groups seek local country partners for such endeavors. They seek well developed projects that are major investment ready.

Mankind's future may very well depend on how we manage food production, energy, water and land use. Solar energy production can be a key factor in this balancing act but the land demand is very high. Hydroponic greenhouse agriculture can be a great asset, but its energy requirements are high. The ideal answer is a self-sufficient and sustainable greenhouse technology which eliminates the need for external energy sources.     Brite Solar is a nano-materials company that has developed a transparent solar glass technology based on Die Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) . The first target market is greenhouse solar glass, which enables the greenhouse to generate electricity needed for sustaining the internal environment. Using this solar glass, the greenhouse's carbon footprint is significantly reduced as its reliance on externally generated electricity is significantly reduced or eliminated. This is a great value proposition for the greenhouse operator since it reduces the operating cost for the greenhouse by 28% which is currently the cost attributed to energy.  Brite's technology is based on nano-materials which are ink-jet printed on to glass panels, eliminating the expensive and complex production facilities needed to produce traditional solar panels. Variations of the technology will also be used to produce auto-dimming glass as well as architectural glass for building construction.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/brite-solar/,,,https://www.facebook.com/Brite-Solar-157524771026537/

Renewable forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, rely on manufactured components more so than extractable energy such as oil. A vibrant manufacturing sector will be needed to supply the new materials needed to rebuild America’s decaying infrastructure and to create a low-carbon economy. The manufacturing sector employs workers at all skill and education levels, and is a particularly important provider of jobs with good wages for workers without a college degree. It employs a higher share of workers without a college degree than does the economy overall. Manufacturing is one of the most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy. It is responsible for roughly two-thirds, or roughly $208 billion, of all U.S. business research and development spending. U.S. manufacturing employment was relatively stable between 1970 and 1998, and never fell below 16.5 million workers. The United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs between March 1998 and 2013. So what can you do? Imagine creating jobs with the swipe of your credit card or helping thousands of unemployed punch a time clock – all because you simply paid closer attention to your shopping decisions. Buying American-made is the most direct way anyone can support American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs. We, as Americans, have the ability to change our own course, expand our middle class, re-ignite our manufacturing base, and provide the opportunity for those less fortunate to join an expanding middle class.",,,,
