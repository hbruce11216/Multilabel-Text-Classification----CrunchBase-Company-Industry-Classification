Right now, they’re not located in areas where EVs will use them the most.  Charging hardware can be costly to develop, purchase, install and maintain, and today's chargers are still largely too slow to support mid- to long-distance travel. Meanwhile, charging operators are dependent on razor thin margins, bartering kWh between consumers and grid operators, while grid operators are ill-prepared for the peak surges EV charging can create. This results in some of the dirtiest and most expensive, power being brought to bear, putting us at a greater risk of brownouts and blackouts thus making resiliency a necessity. Solar by itself is great and has demonstrated to provide positive long-term returns for some time, but without optimization from battery storage, and other sources, many of its potential benefits can be lost.

We're creating a 'Bring Your Own Data' model for consumers, so they can give retailers access to their preferences and digital data, on-demand, at locations of their choice.  Our business service provides brick-and-mortar retail with actionable information in real-time on any Point-Of-Sale system or internet-connected device the moment a Regulr customer enters a store's doors. We deliver this real-time customer insight in the form of an automated push notification, displaying relevant information about an individual customer so any staff member or sales team can warmly greet them by name, with a smile, and tailor the experience to the customer's liking. We are striving to go a step further in privacy by enabling consumers to manage access to their data and opt-in to these types of experiences; creating a dynamic not possible before at a time where consumers are losing trust in the platforms and technologies they use daily. At the same time though, consumers are demanding more personalized experiences than ever before and are placing an even higher value on experiences in the real world which is why Regulr is well suited to deliver true omnichannel experiences for those that want it. Regulr plans to be the authentic and transparent channel for businesses and consumers to engage with each other on-demand.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/regulr/,,https://twitter.com/Regulr_App,https://www.facebook.com/pg/regulrapprva,"294,284"

The onboarding process is extremely simple and it takes no more than a couple minutes to set up an account. To collect money, you have to apply and a member of Team Moulah approves everyone on an individual basis to make sure you are real, safe, and intend to use Moulah in a legitimate way. Once you are approved, you can create listings in the app, by clicking on “My Listings”. Complete your listing by adding a picture, description, address, and the start/end time. During the times the listing is active, anyone within a 2 mile radius can see it, and if applicable, pay.  To pay, all you have to do is download the app, create an account and add a credit or debit card. Moulah is developed with security in mind. We use industry standard end-to-end encryption technologies to protect your data as it is being transmitted across our system, so you can be sure your information is protected in transit.

Never try to get the attention of a waiter again, dine at your own pace without interruptions. After one year of development and testing, we were selected by a Miami-based startup accelerator to be in their 2013 class.

No need for any new equipment or complex implementation, it is a self-service model. This translates into scalability. We will have our commercial launch at the Collision Conference in Las Vegas on May 13th. The US is our current target market, but we designed Tabber to be launched anywhere in the world with little effort.

My Outdoor Calendar now allows customers to book online. Hunting and Fishing business owners can now use the same technology that their main stream destination counterparts have been using for years. The system also provides management for all payments that come to the outfitters, and creates reports that help the business track sales and trends. My Outdoor Calendar offers outdoor businesses a way to create the ultimate experience for customers, whether they are booking online or using a custom built point-of-sale system. After asking John where he felt the outdoor industry was going, he explained how outfitters could enhance their product offering and take advantage of all thier existing web efforts. Price says, ""Prepare for adjusting your product for what your customers want. The company was originally set up to fix the way people booked hunting and fishing trips; but what ended up happening was much more. The designed system is used not only to help the outfitter book more trips, but to track sales, discover trends, promote specials, and manage the business."" His partner Sam chimed in, ""I feel like my job is two parts, education and implementation. You can have the coolest site in the world but if you dont have a way to monetize your traffic then you might as well not have a website at all."" My Outdoor Calendar assists guides and outfitters in their mission to grow their outfitting business through technology. Dryden states: ""There is a need to keep people in the field hunting and fishing, and My Outdoor Calendar enhances the possibilities to reach outdoorsmen, young and old, and to keep the timeless tradition alive. You have to adapt to the way the next generation of hunters spends their money."" With the introduction of My Outdoor Calendar, outfitters can now leverage the widespread accessibility of the Internet, as well as the total online booking and management package that the Calendar offers, in order to reach more customers and to make booking their outdoor adventures easier than ever. My Outdoor Calendar has already grabbed the attention of clients such as fly fishing shops, marinas, and dude ranches from coast to coast utilizing this tool to increase sales. Hunting Square, which is the parent company of My Outdoor Calendar, plans to launch the full version of its website in the near future. The new site will allow users to search for hunting trips, book online, read reviews, and many more features. John and Sam continue to keep the ball rolling by enhancing the hunting and fishing communities experience online.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/1121586,,http://twitter.com/myoutdoorcal,http://www.facebook.com/myoutdoorcalendar,"1,044,621"
