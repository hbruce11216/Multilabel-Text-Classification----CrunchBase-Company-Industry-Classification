Together they have developed a new process incorporating video game technology with photorealistic 3D models inserted into film and TV broadcast,  to disrupt the $23B branded entertainment industry. Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.

Right now, they’re not located in areas where EVs will use them the most.  Charging hardware can be costly to develop, purchase, install and maintain, and today's chargers are still largely too slow to support mid- to long-distance travel. Meanwhile, charging operators are dependent on razor thin margins, bartering kWh between consumers and grid operators, while grid operators are ill-prepared for the peak surges EV charging can create. This results in some of the dirtiest and most expensive, power being brought to bear, putting us at a greater risk of brownouts and blackouts thus making resiliency a necessity. Solar by itself is great and has demonstrated to provide positive long-term returns for some time, but without optimization from battery storage, and other sources, many of its potential benefits can be lost. Meanwhile, restaurant and retail customers are increasingly looking for safe ways to continue traveling while enjoying the brands they love, without necessarily having to wait in line inside the physical location.    ChargeNet’s patent-pending cloud based IP solves all these problems, and more, by optimizing and stacking these value streams into one consolidated solution built to scale for the EV and clean energy revolution, while maximizing returns for customers, partners and investors. Our competitive moat is that we use point-of-sale data to predict how long an EV driver will be at the charger and optimize charging arrays, solar, and energy storage to provide maximum returns by increasing operational efficiency.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/chargenet-stations/,,https://twitter.com/ChargeNetStnUS,https://www.facebook.com/ChargeNet-Stations-110371134115824,"50,276"

PROBLEM •	Online shopping does not provide customers a way to experience the product like they can at the store. •	Written content is not well suited for a mobile-first, social-sharing world. •	Retailers and brands want video because they know their shoppers want it (over 80% of all Internet traffic will be video by 2019 and because it sells more product). •	Retailers and brands don’t have enough video because producing, gathering or managing enough video to meet customer demand is logistically and financially impossible. SOLUTION •	Criteek enhances the shopping experience and engages shoppers with personalized customer-generated video directly on the product page, leading to increased sales. •	Criteek patent-pending technology streamlines the process of activating customers, then gathering, screening, hosting, managing and streaming their video to the product page and social networks, and sharing it among marketing partners, through an easily-managed online dashboard.  •	Clients get a sustainable, scaled pipeline of credible video from their customers and their partners for the cost of moderation. •	Criteek collects proprietary data with insights into the shopping experience, how shoppers consume video and how video can be used to increase sales. WHY NOW? Brands and retailers can no longer compete on price and product differentiation alone. Now, they are competing squarely on customer experience.  Video is the immediately scalable medium that transforms the customer experience.  Recognizing this, Amazon has begun to gather and stream video reviews from their customers.  However, their tech is proprietary. Criteek now provides brands and retailers with a way to remain competitive. TECHNOLOGY 	Tech is patent-pending. 	Tech is difficult to build. 	The platform creates value by:  -- helping clients increase shopper engagement and sales; -- providing an interdependent video content network among those clients; -- producing a proprietary data set around video & eCommerce. TEAM Scott Randall, CEO 	Founded BrandGames, the first company to leverage videogames as media 	Marketed to Fortune 500 companies, including Pizza Hut, GAP, TacoBell, & Pepsi 	Sold BrandGames in 2001 	Built the digital & ecommerce infrastructure for a $220mm children’s brand 	Marketing thought leader – presented at global conferences (Milken Global Conference) 	Award winning marketer - Marketing Technology Award, WebAwards, Art Direction’s Creativity Award, Davey Award, Communicator Award Rahul Khosla, CTO 	Founder - eDynamic: marketing tech agency 	ex-Accenture consultant and digital marketing executive 	Advised and consulted Fortune 500 firms on marketing technology 	Marketing automation expert Kyle Wilkinson, COO 	BI & marketing analytics at GILT & BTR 	Customer data modeling expert 	Derivatives modeler & trader 	Built & managed financial risk models COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 	Criteek’s patent-pending technology has the ability to capture, moderate, stream & syndicate video across multiple domains. 	Criteek creates an eco-system of video content sharing: --video is easily acquired from customers, partners & social networks and creates a content-sharing network. 	Criteek creates platform dependency for users   --clients depend on video-sharing content pipeline. 	Criteek produces data & insight: --the Criteek platform gives us a proprietary view of the use, sharing & performance of video for use in increasing client sales.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/criteek/,,https://www.twitter.com/criteekit,https://www.facebook.com/criteek,"78,945"

VISION  'Chasing' the Wind vision is to bend curves, bridge divides, eradicate IT gates; fighting the corporatocratic climate that has placed more emphasis on sub-optimal optimization and bottom-line profitability than empowering employees and providing total customer satisfaction through continuous improvement and quality management principles.

Unquestionable ethics  RECESSIONARY ISSUES The North American economy has seen an amazing decade of growth. The market recession was inevitable. While pandemic epidemics' could have been preventable. Employer Employee loyalty is no longer in existence.  Wealth gaps widen.  IT and digital skills gaps are getting ignored.  Systemic rot sits top-down.  While sustainability gets tossed around as a now trending keyword. And the elderly are getting abused by database con-artists, family members, and entitled neighbors.  with Wind works tirelessly at:  - Bending curves. - Closing gaps. - Bridging divides.  - Eradicating gates, and  - Fighting systemic issues driven by corruption, kickbacks, bureaucracy, and hypocrisy.

An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him “do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By 1958, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today. Ed Stack, Dick’s son, is the current CEO and Chairman of DICK’S Sporting Goods. He and his siblings bought the store from their father and are responsible for taking two stores and growing the chain to over 500 stores. Dick’s family continues to offer the finest quality products at competitive prices, backed by the best service anywhere. Like you, they have a real passion for sports.

The mission of 1ON1 is to offer search engine optimization training to entrepreneurs, small business owners, marketing professionals, website designers, and other individuals who have a website in a format that can allow them to directly apply lessons to their own businesses and learn based on their own needs and at their own pace.   1ON1 SEO training course was designed by Bruce Jones, an SEO tutor and industry expert who realized that there existed two main flaws with SEO that were inhibiting results. First, traditional SEO services offer optimizing websites as part of a digital marketing strategy. While these can work wonderfully, the client must continue to pay for search engine optimization, or else it will overtime become ineffective, since the client does not know how to keep up with the strategy after the optimization package is no longer being paid for. Second, those individuals that are wise to seek out an SEO teacher are offered group classes where they are taught at a fast pace about general information and are not given the chance to apply teachings to their own website.   Ultimately, your best investment when it comes to SEO is knowledge and a functioning skillset which will allow you to become your own expert. That is why the best SEO training course is one that gives you individual classes and works on your own website with you, based on your goals and needs.   Online Courses with your own SEO teacher  Our service offers a comprehensive one on one SEO training with an expert SEO tutor, who uses a virtual classroom to teach individual lessons that cater to your skillset and needs.

SteadyTake,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/steadytake,https://www.steadytake.com,"Digital Marketing, Digital Media, Video, Video Streaming","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Video",Scalable digital video production,"What does it cost to produce a video? If you have spent any time attempting to get a quote for a video you want produced, I'm sure you've discovered that prices are all over the place from $99 to $50,000. With that kind of price range it's helpful to know why? This article is written to provide some transparency in how video production is priced. Pricing for video can be compared to automobiles like Lexus and Toyota. Lexus is built by Toyota but features are added to a Toyota beyond the ""requirements"" to produce the luxury brand Lexus. To open this conversation its important to understand that technology has reduced the effort and thereby cost of production through digital recording vs. linear tape, user-friendly digital suites for editing and bandwidth that supports cloud distribution. Lighter, cheaper and innovated advancement in equipment allows any talented producer to create content for a fraction of the cost previously. So, why are the prices still so high? For reasons not really understood, the industry has taken a long time to shift its dependence on high price tags even though the demand for high-priced video has dropped like a stone. But one factor is the cost of overhead. A studio full of equipment requiring insurance and repairs with employees is a nut that has to be covered by a handful of jobs per month. This is because the industry is a gig-based economy with jobs coming along sporatically. As a result, a local studio or videographer must charge a high price to stay in business. Lower prices have also emerged due to competition for gigs posted to online marketplaces like Upwork, Freelancer, etc. So, based on the above, what does it really cost to produce a video? The breakdown is as follows. A plan and treatment are required before starting any filming. So, if you need a script written or a storyboard built, either you will need to do it (to save money) or pay a professional to help you. So, several hours of a creative director will be required to get you started. Then once the plan is set, the creative assets are created from voice recording to capture of footage, per the plan. Finally, editing. This sounds simplistic but it really is not. All in all, it's about time spent during each process, how many people performing it, and the cost of that resource. Bottom line, the cost of time is based upon the skill required with the videographer in the field being the most costly at about $100 an hour with his/her equipment (per camera). An Editor is 1/2 that as well as a creative director. Then there are more tasks, who is directing? Who is responsible for lighting and sound? If your videographer is also a DP (Director of Photography) he/she can direct your production and manage sound and lighting with an assistant called a PA (production assistant). So, how long does it take to do each task? It depends entirely upon what the end result will be. A simple 1-minute, 1 camera, 1 location video would generally cost $600-$750 finished. A 2-minute, 3 camera, 4 location video would cost $4,000 - $6,000. So, when you are trying to figure out how much your video is going to cost, a simple rule of thumb is keep it simple or plan for a higher budget so you never sacrifice quality which is the most important feature of all. So, pricing above this is profit or goes to the creative team that is designing your video strategy and your videos. The $99 video is a DIY (do-it-yourself) video using an online ad-creator.
