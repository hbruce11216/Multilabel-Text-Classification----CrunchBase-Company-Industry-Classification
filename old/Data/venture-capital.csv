The firm is founded by veterans of the interdealer broker industry alongside a group of very experienced settlement experts.    The primary focus of the business is to purchase, package, sell and provide servicing of guaranteed future cash flows to the individual investors that work with their institutional clients.     One of the fundamental differences between SMA Hub and others in the space is Hub's ability to warehouse annuities by buying inventory using a line of credit, secured by the structures themselves. Most brokers attempt to purchase directly from the sellers agent through a court ordered process. There are many flaws in this process that can often result in trades failing to consummate while the potential investor identity could become a matter of public record. The warehouse approach employed by SMA Hub has effectively insulated the end investor from any negative associations with the transfer process and has proved hugely popular.    SMA Hub, Inc. and the Hub Business Trust seeks additional capital for its current secured line of credit warehousing activity. As a secured lender to the Hub Business Trust, the lender’s capital is used to hold long term fixed income assets on a short term basis while the assets are marketed for re-sale.

CompBlue will """"rent-a captive"""" from an existing highly rated insurance carrier which will provide the coverage and strength necessary to get the product to market - under the name of CompBlue. CompBlue essentially purchases the insurance at wholesale and sells it to the public at retail. CompBlue collects the premiums from its customers, pays the wholesale cost to the carrier, and passes the net revenues from the margin on to its investors. Reserves/Collateral enables CompBlue to write $4.06 in retail policies for every $1.00 in reserves. From the $4.06, $3.00 goes to pay buy the wholesale policy and $1.06 is retained by the LLC for operations and distribution to investors. Within the framework of the wholesale policy, premiums paid for the coverage (wholesale cost of goods) are used to provide (1) income to the carrier, purchase administrative, infrastructure, and claims processing (approx. 25% of premium); plus re-insurance as required by law (approx. 10% of premium); (2) pay any losses from injuries to covered workers (19%-55%); with the remaining funds (10%-46% of premium) (3) being retained by the """"rent-a-captive"""" as additional reserves/collateral for future policies (Retained Captive Earnings). Each policy issued is collateralized once at inception, with the same collateral in force each year the policy is renewed. For example: $25k collateralizes a $100k policy in year one. That same $25k continues to collateralize it year by year. In 10 years that $25k has collateralized $1mm in premium.

Fashion Fund solves for this by injecting metered growth capital into promising, content marketed brands that challenge traditional (safe) choices. Fashion is very influence and market driven.

Investment opportunities are scored on an 87-point dynamic checklist that tests their product-market fit, market readiness and business sophistication while the investor questionnaire qualifies their propensity and niche interests, thereby making better matches.
