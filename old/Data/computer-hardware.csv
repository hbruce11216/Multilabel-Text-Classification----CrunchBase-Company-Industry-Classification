The company offers software as a service platform that enables the business to business marketers to develop data-driven content marketing strategies. The B2B buying journey is more complex and multifaceted than it’s ever been. Sales cycles are longer and more individuals are involved in buying decisions, each with their own roles and priorities. They’ve also entered a new era where buyers are discovering and learning about companies through multiple online touchpoints, making content the centerpiece of their buying journey. These changes require that successful B2B marketers be buyer-centric. To rise above the noise and drive engagement and consensus among the multiple people (personas) in an account, marketers must provide high-quality content, messaging, and interactions that support buyers’ needs and processes in the manner they desire. Achieving this, however, is dependent on having a truly deep understanding of your buyers. The challenge marketers face is that existing technologies do not fully support this shift from being vendor-centric to buyer-centric because they’re solely focused on execution. While content production, account-based marketing, and personalization solutions exist, none of them can be used to their potential without first having Marketing-Sales alignment on the audience, how they buy, and how to effectively sell to them.

Originally a systems integrator engaged by Global 1000 enterprises to monitor, manage, and maintain vast enterprise networks, using existing platforms, Auconet recognized the need for a better approach.  Auconet’s customers had been unable to find any truly vendor-independent solution for network management.

The Company has three products scheduled for production: •The SunDuo™ T16 is a roof or ground mounted solar/thermal system with low cost combined heat and power. •The SunDuo™ G16 is a ground-mounted solar/thermal system for uneven terrain ideal for off-grid applications. •The SunTrio™ combines either the T16 or the G16 with a desalination system built to Beltane’s specification and private label manufactured for distribution. SunDuo™ creates electricity and hot water from a solar photovoltaic and thermal receiver. Reflectors concentrate sunlight, reducing the PV cells required by 93%. The receiver captures the valuable thermal energy produced by cooling PV cells so they operate more efficiently. The thermal energy is used by C&I CHP customers to offset the cost of their water heating requirements. Integrated tracking collects 30-40% more energy throughout the day and collects 60-100% more energy during peak utility demand charge periods in the late afternoon. We have determined that the scalable SunDuo™ has the lowest levelized cost of electricity in its market and the highest IRR in its class. SunTrio™ systems are designed for the distributed desalination market for the production of agricultural, industrial and drinking water. It provides a scalable distributed solution combining SunDuo™ collectors with proven, private labeled desalination systems. The point-of-use system is deployable in underserved areas that have extensive brackish water resources. Unlike brick-and-mortar facilities, the SunTrio™ does not require infrastructure and pipelines.

Their original field of emphasis was in environmental database statistical processing (thus the name ‘biometrics’, which is the quantitative analysis of biological data). They developed several useful programs in their early years on a Cyber (Control Data Corp.) computer. With the advent of the early 8-bit personal computers some of these programs were ported to 8-bit microcomputer operating systems. As their reputation grew for the environmental analysis programs which they had developed, they began branching out into custom software development for a few local businesses. These businesses, in turn, recommended us to others and their software business burgeoned.  Their OASIS/THEOS experience dates back to some of the earliest versions of the operating system, which ran on Digital Group and Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II microcomputers. As the computer industry matured, they evolved through the Altos and IBC multi-user environments, into today’s Intel Pentium based computers, adding experience in XENIX and UNIX as 16 – and 32 – bit Personal Computers came to market.

CDRLabs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cdrlabs,http://cdrlabs.com,"Communication Hardware, Computer, Network Hardware","Consumer Electronics, Hardware",The majority of the people here at CDRlabs.com started as ops in #cdr on Efnet nearly 15 years ago.,"The majority of the people here at CDRlabs.com started as ops in #cdr on Efnet nearly 15 years ago. This was way before every kid on the block had a CD-RW. We maybe had at most 20 people in the channel at a time. About a year or two later the CD-R industry exploded. Dropping media and hardware prices and the ability to put 650mb or even 700mb onto a disk and take it with you became appealing to everyone. People kept asking if there was a really good website for optical storage related information. Unfortunately there was not at the time. A few ""hardware review sites"" would do a review from time to time, but the depth and consistency of the reviews turned out to be less than desirable. A plan was hatched to create a CDR Zone, a portal to the world of CD-R related reviews and topics. When having a portal was not good enough, the CDR Labs was spawned to give the world what it was lacking: useful, truthful information, quality reviews of hardware and software, and an eye to the CD-R Industry. Welcome to CDRLabs. In research, you are urged to be skeptical of information until you know the people behind the experiment and the methods used to bring results. We would not want you to think otherwise. Every review we do will have explicit details about what test systems we used, what methodology was used, and what benchmarking software was used. For example, we could tell you that a certain CD-R has buffer underrun problems, and therefore should be avoided. But what if we were burning at 8x off of a USB Zip Drive? Would that change your mind as to the quality of our testing, and our ability to give you a straight recommendation? Of course it would. When components are tested, you will know the machine driving that component down to the very last detail so you can judge our work. You will be able to make an educated decision. That is our mantra. Furthermore, what qualifies any of us to bring this to you? All of us work in the computer industry in some form. From designing supercomputers for Cray Inc. to being a systems administrator at a Big 10 college, our staff have a large knowledge base and a wide variety of experience. Our real jobs keep us in touch with technology, and that makes us able to offer insights that you would not be able to get elsewhere. Our goals: To bring a website dedicated to bringing truthful, informative reviews and news to optical storage enthusiasts. Too many other hardware review sites were doing what we considered to be poor benchmarking and reviewing of drives and others were just re-worded Press Releases. Other sites supposedly dedicated to optical storage were reporting rumors as truth and many were tied into piracy and other illegal activities. After CDRZone.com, we stood back and looked at the highlights and lowlights of the reviews we had done and ones we had read on other websites and created the CDRLabs' Tome of Benchmarking. We pledge that CDRLabs will give you the best of previews, reviews, and related Industry news.",,,https://twitter.com/cdrlabs,https://www.facebook.com/CDRLabs

When Adam Lancaster, VP of technology sales for Cold Creek, heard that CSS was planning a storage refresh, he urged the company to consider solutions outside of the EMC box – namely, the unified storage family from Hitachi Data Systems (HDS). With configuration expertise provided by the local HDS team and logistical and financial support from Arrow ECS, Cold Creek was able to propose a best-of-both-worlds solution that leveraged a Hitachi Unified Storage (HUS) front end for virtualization and utilized CSS’s existing EMC storage resources on the back end. The solution also came in at about one half the cost of the proposed Symmetrix VMAX solution from EMC. “The pricing ended up being what they needed, but Hitachi really stood apart from a technology perspective,” says Warwick. “Number one, the HUS would allow us to virtualize and extend the usability of their EMC assets that weren’t ready for end of life. Second, it would be quickly and easily scalable with flash drives that slot right into the normal chassis. And finally, it was developed with an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) architecture, so they knew it was purpose-built for meeting enterprise storage demands.”",https://www.linkedin.com/company/cold-creek-solutions/,,https://twitter.com/coldcreektech,https://www.facebook.com/ColdCreekSolutions
