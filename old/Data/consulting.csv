For college students and recent grads, Parker Dewey provides the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and grit, explore careers, develop their networks, and generate income as they seek internships and full-time roles. Furthermore, these authentic, experiential learning opportunities complement in-class instruction, thereby improving academic performance and driving completion. As a result, career launchers graduate more job-ready, and have the perspective and experience to find a full-time role with the right skill and cultural fit. Using data from these projects, Parker Dewey also provides insights to college and university faculty so that they can better align curriculum with job skills demanded by companies. In addition, these academic institutions can more effectively engage alumni and professors as mentors, counsel students on career options, and support existing and / or prospective corporate recruiters. Parker Dewey made it really easy for everyone to use the platform. It takes under five minutes to post a project (including setting the price and due date), career launchers apply only to those assignments that interest them, and companies select who they think is the best fit.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner. Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/2003,,http://twitter.com/nasa,http://www.facebook.com/NASA,"35,247"

Founded in 2006 in St. Louis, the company’s revolutionary antenna technology allows for previously unforeseen advances in RFID technology by eliminating barriers to end user adoption while reducing infrastructure costs. RF Controls’ smart antenna hardware and software enables application of passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID in real time location systems (RTLS). RF Controls’ bi-directional electronic steerable phased array antennas, which are core components of its Intelligent Tracking and Control System (ITCS®), use patented antenna technology to send a signal to a passive RFID tag, excite the tag (wake it up), and capture and read data from the tag. RF Controls real-time location systems are the only products in the world capable of tracking UHF passive RFID tags in real time, with accuracy of 12 inches. RF Controls has been awarded a foundational patent for its Intelligent Tracking and Control System. ITCS is best classified as a wide area RTLS  because ITCS provides much more than just tag identification data. By installing ITCS “smart antennas,” end users can illuminate an area (or volume) in which tagged items move or are stored, and achieve real-time, perpetual monitoring of an entire warehouse or retail floor. ITCS solves the fundamental business process problem of automatically and accurately locating arbitrarily placed tagged items without the spurious read problems inherent to other RFID systems.   RF Controls recently announced a joint venture with Stanley Black & Decker, View Technologies LLC.  Stanley Black & Decker is providing manufacturing, sales, marketing, installation, software and administrative services to the joint venture while RF Controls, in addition to ongoing scientific development, is providing an exclusive global license to its suite of groundbreaking bi-directional, steerable phased array fixed antenna systems.",,,http://twitter.com/RFIDFan,https://www.facebook.com/rfcontrols,"55,944"

Vacom has advanced the technology over 20 years and in 2013 introduced the next generation, the Vacom Crystallizer that achieves Zero Liquid Discharge.     As governments at all levels implement regulations to protect our precious natural water resources, industrial based businesses, manufacturers, and chemical plants are being forced to adjust to a new reality of more stringent regulations that prohibit discharging polluted waste streams into the watershed. US based power plants are facing new EPA regulations on Zero Liquid Discharge. The Oil and Gas industry struggles to deal with the vast volumes of produced waters that need remediation. Industrial and chemical plants face high transportation and disposal to rid themselves of their polluted waste streams.     The Vacom Crystallizer is a dramatically more efficient and cost-effective single step process that its competitors cannot match. It is 90% smaller, 60% less expensive and operates at considerably lower costs. The system provides customers with quick returns, reduced costs, and environmental regulation compliance. It is not theory or an engineering idea. It is proven and working field. We are raising capital to accelerate our market penetration and capture the significant opportunities at hand.",,,,,"102,217"

Avivid Water applies its patented TurboCoag© process to the known technology of electrocoagulation (EC). EC systems work by passing contaminated liquids over electrically charged plates creating a reaction, which causes the contaminants to be precipitated out in solid sludge form. Avivid Water has solved difficulties with passivization which will now allow EC to become the system of choice to treat waters with emulsified oils, poorly settling solids and poorly soluble organics that add turbidity, odor and color to water. EC is highly effective for removing arsenic, heavy metals, and soluble organic compounds. Microorganisms are killed in the process of EC treatment. Special applications such as arsenic removal, latex paint extraction and polymer cleanup, coal/sulfur/clay/water separation, and environmental remediation projects are ideally suitable for TurboCoag© . Avivid Water’s system is best described as a combination of a pumping system, integrated with an innovative self-cleaning cell that coagulates suspended material, reacts with contaminates, kills microbes and precipitates a sludge containing these contents. In addition to its self-cleaning features, the system increases current density through the fluid and allows for a smaller reactor for any given volume of water. The design is optimized for servicing of the reactor in the field and can be scaled to treat high volumes of water on a continuous basis. The patent for this product was awarded in April 2013. Avivid Water’s TurboCoag© has achieved a revolutionary improvement over prior EC technologies but maintains common features of EC which are:   • Dramatically lowering the costs of waste processing for many contaminants  • Creating less non-toxic sludge that is suitable for landfill by using no chemicals",,,,,"102,221"
