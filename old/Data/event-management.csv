In 1985, McKenna launched California County magazine in partnership with the California State Association of Counties. Early to recognize the impact new digital technologies would have on the public sector, in 1987, Dennis launched Government Technology, the first national magazine covering information technology in state and local government. Other successful media platforms followed, including Public CIO and Emergency Management. All have won numerous editorial and design awards. In 2013, Emergency Management magazine was named Magazine of the Year for overall excellence by ASBPE (American Society of Business Publication Editors), Public CIO was named Magazine of the Year in 2007 and Government Technology and Emergency Management have both been named best publication in their respective categories by the Western Publishing Association. Seeing the need for stronger analysis and research to support public sector innovation, Dennis developed the Center for Digital Government—the first-of-its-kind research and business intelligence advisory institute focused exclusively on state and local government. The Center is home to the widely cited Digital States Survey. In 2009, e.Republic acquired Governing from Congressional Quarterly. Governing covers politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. Recognized as the most credible and authoritative voice in its field, Governing provides non-partisan news, insight and analysis on budget and finance; transportation and infrastructure; workforce and economic development; health and human services and more. Since the acquisition, the publication has grown, with an expanded online presence and launch of the Governing Institute, headed by former Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser. Governing has also greatly expanded its national events portfolio. In 2011 Governing received the prestigious Jesse H. Neal Award from American Business Media for exceptional editorial content. With over 200 employees in California, Washington, D.C. and throughout the United States, e.Republic is a unique company redefining the role of media at the intersection of innovation and public service.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/e.republic-inc.,,http://twitter.com/erepublic,http://www.facebook.com/erepublicinc,"130,984"

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization. Increase collaboration, drive sales, build better relationships, and deliver optimized omnichannel customer experiences. The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more.

They've performed together for 30 years; skewering the genre of magic, their sold-out audiences, and themselves -- very often all at the same time, within one mind-boggling evening. September is an exciting month for the duo as they celebrate their fifth year as headliners in their own theater at the Rio All-suite Hotel & Casino, as well as two Emmy nominations for their Showtime series, ""Penn & Teller: Bullshit!"" And along the way, Penn & Teller have made the hardest trick of all a remarkable career that ranges from stage to television to three best-selling books look easy.

Since first teaming up in 1975, when they combined Teller's silent, occasionally creepy, magic with Penn's clown college education and juggling expertise, the two have created an entertainment success story that went from the streets to small clubs to national theater tours, and now to a current, multi-year engagement at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. By 1985, Penn & Teller were receiving rave reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy award-winning PBS special, Penn & Teller Go Public. In 1987, they began the first of two successful Broadway runs. Penn & Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise from New York to San Francisco for bringing a fresh slant to an often-tired show business realm. The first of more than 20 appearances on Late Night with David Letterman soon followed, along with appearances on a wide range of television: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Miami Vice, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Hollywood Squares, The Today Show, Saturday Night Live, The Drew Carey Show, Friends, Dharma & Greg, Home Improvement, and one of television's most honored rolls: animated guests on The Simpsons. They also created their own television projects, including Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular, Penn & Teller's Home Invasion, the Showtime movie Penn & Teller's Invisible Thread, and the NBC specials Don't Try This at Home and Penn & Teller: Off The Deep End. Penn & Teller made their big screen debut in Penn & Teller Get Killed and were featured in Walt Disney's Fantasia 2000 . In 2005 Penn & Teller lent their version of the world's dirtiest joke to the critically acclaimed documentary, The Aristocrats. The film, produced and co-created by Penn, is now available on DVD. Penn & Teller's understanding of magic and their ability to relate to audiences has also garnered serious academic attention. They serve as Visiting Scholars at MIT, that school's highest honor, and have lectured at Oxford University and the Smithsonian Institution. In 2001, they received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award. Penn & Teller have written three best-selling books, Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends, How to Play with Your Food, and How to Play in Traffic; and penned pieces in outlets ranging from The New York Times to Playboy.",,,http://twitter.com/pennjillette,http://www.facebook.com/PennAndTeller,"264,048"

In short, we are an e-commerce company with proven track record of changing the way how individual services behind Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions are promoted and contracted. We have started our quest back in 2013 with the most difficult challenge in event management – weddings – and solved broken process of their cancellations. As most of you know, weddings are expensive, very personal and therefore very difficult to handle. Canceling them isn’t much cheaper. Only in the US, each year 13 % weddings get cancelled making it a market worth $7bil of the total $55bil wedding market. Our secondary marketplace project CanceledWeddings.com offers unique social brokerage features for wedding service contracting, negotiation and secure transfers to cost savvy couples. It’s a win-win for everyone because the selling couple doesn’t lose all their money sunk in nonrefundable deposits and cancellation fees while the buying couple gets a really good bargain. At the same time, wedding service providers have now a simple solution how to deal with wedding cancellations and unsold late availabilities. They don’t lose a date that they weren’t able to sell at full price and even enjoy new incremental revenues. But wait, it’s not all only about e-commerce of weddings and honeymoons. If you look around at how different market segments and whole industries have changed due to the Internet and the network economy, you realize that for the MICE industry to adapt, it has to change. We, at TRACTIMO, are here to disrupt the status quo and enable this change.",,,https://twitter.com/CanceledWedding,https://www.facebook.com/CanceledWeddings/,"483,809"
