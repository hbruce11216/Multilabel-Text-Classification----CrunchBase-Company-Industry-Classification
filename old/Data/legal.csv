The company's founders recognized that while paper-based communication offered proof and protection for senders through mechanisms such as fax logs, mail receipts and courier tracking services, there was no comparable product for electronic correspondence that was effective or flexible enough to use with any email address. RPost has filled this gap through its ability to legally verify precisely what email content and attachments were sent and received, by whom and when, in a simple and elegant service offering. RPost services based upon the Registered Email technology prove legal delivery, content and time for email. For around the price of a postage stamp, Registered Email services protect the sender of email in case of a subsequent dispute about what they sent, whether it was received, or when. Specifically, Registered Email services provide the sender with legal and verifiable evidence of the content and time any email has been sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world. Recipients of Registered Email messages do not need any special software, and are not required to take any compliant action to open their email. The Registered Email technology dates back to early patent filings in 1995. Efforts to begin commercialization of the technology described in these patents began in 2000. Services based on this technology have been used by the United States Government Accounting Office continuously since 2003 and international law firms including Greenberg Traurig LLP, since 2004. Today, world-class companies in a variety of industries use Registered Email technology to cut cost, save time, and reduce risk for communications between parties in nearly every country of the world.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/85232,,http://twitter.com/rpost,http://www.facebook.com/RPostInc,"23,238"

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner.

Quietly it has been building market share in the legal research market for lawyers, with more than 800,000 subscribers.   Fastcase's legal research service is poised to make some major changes in the way that lawyers access the law.  It sorts results algorithmically, like Google, bringing the best results to the top.  But more than that, it incorporates citation analysis right into the results, so you can see which cases are most cited.  The service also allows customized results -- users can sort results a dozen ways to emphasize what's important to them. The service is also the first to move legal research beyond the tired ""search-results-document"" paradigm, with cool data visualization tools that create beautiful, four-dimensional maps of search results.  The most important cases jump off the pages in these maps -- just one of many interesting tools that make Fastcase a smarter alternative for legal research. This is a paradigm shift.  In the past, the emphasis in legal research was on taxonomic or editorial tools that helped lawyers or legal researchers find the most important cases, kind of like Yahoo's categories helped people find pages on the early Web.  Fastcase allows users to organize the law with search tools and intelligent algorithms, much like Google did in the Web.  And like Google, once people use Fastcase's search tools, they find it difficult to go back to the old, pre-chewed editorial indexes of traditional legal research. In February of 2010, Fastcase introduced the first legal research application for the iPhone (www.fastcase.com/iPhone) -- which is free to download and free to use (free registration required).  Apple has ranked the app as one of its featured ""What's Hot"" applications, and it has been one of the most downloaded free reference apps in iTunes.

To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics.  For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities.  For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost. Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.   For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations.  With DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/datanovo-inc-?trk=company_logo,,https://twitter.com/datanovo,https://www.facebook.com/datanovoUSA,"65,440"

The firm's focus has always been helping people and businesses interact with government. Joe founded his law firm initially to help claimants applying for disability benefits through the Social Security (SSDI/SSI) and the Veterans' Administrations (VA). He knows firsthand that dealing with the federal government can be frustrating and unnecessarily confusing.     Many of the veteran business owners that came to Whitcomb Law, PC, indicated a desire to start their own business and eventually become verified as Veteran owned in order to improve their chances of winning government contracts. Joe and his team have grown that practice area from a few small clients who had done little more than file Articles of Incorporation, to more than 70 commercial clients all over the U.S. By keeping the practice areas federal, Whitcomb Law has effectively thrown off the geographical limitations that encumber many law firms. By maintaining a largely transactional and administrative practice, the firm is able to expand its scope, while minimizing infrastructure costs.    By creating a hybrid business model of long term contingency fee work and short term hourly engagements, the firm accomplishes near full utilization of human resources, while maintaining a work-life balance that drastically reduces turn-over and increases team buy-in. Diversification served the firm when government shutdowns, sequestration, and budget cuts were killing other less diverse firms. The firm's focus in advertising in online mediums including well placed PPC campaigns and organic SEO efforts have increased its visibility nationally. Any outside investment would be used to further increase this visibility as well has hiring the attorneys and legal staff needed to serve the additional clients.

This is our story. In May 1872, a tall, 34 year-old, red-bearded lawyer stepped down from the stage-coach at the Plaza of Los Angeles. Corporate attorney John Bicknell had his sights on building a law practice. What greeted him at the stage was a humble little pueblo with dusty unpaved street, no industry and scant business. He saw a pueblo of narrow streets and alleys between decrepit adobe buildings roofed with ""brea"" from tar pits west of the city. Bicknell, who had summed up his philosophy this way when counseling a younger lawyer, ""The safe way is to select a business that you will be satisfied to follow and build up a business of your own."" He began to follow his own advice. By the 1880s, he had attracted one of the region's most important clients, the Southern Pacific Railroad. It took time to select a quality partner. But in 1890, Bicknell, a Republican, teamed with Walter Trask, a Democratic litigator, thus launching the unbroken chain of partnership that today is Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Also launched was a set of unique firm attributes. Those included selecting only quality lawyers; balancing ideas across the political spectrum; and providing powerful resources in both transactional and litigation-related legal services. More than a century later, these attributes still define today's Gibson Dunn. In 1897 Judge James Gibson joined the firm, thus instituting another Gibson Dunn tradition – hiring lawyers who make an impact in their communities. In 1903, in a move that created the largest firm in Los Angeles, Bicknell, Trask and Gibson merged their practice with that of former Los Angeles City Attorney William Dunn and former Assistant City Attorney Albert Crutcher. Carried out at the behest of a client in order to create a ""full-service"" firm, the combination was called an ""experiment"" in the local press. It has worked ever since. Nearly 100 years later, the press recently dubbed the firm ""The Rescue Squad"" for its response and service to clients in legal need. Another article remarked that it remains easier to get into the CIA than to become a lawyer at Gibson Dunn. The firm grew as the region grew, into both Northern and Southern California, and both nationally and internationally. By the 1970s, Gibson Dunn had offices in London and Paris. Shortly thereafter, the firm took the bold step of launching its practice in the nation's capital and New York. Since 2000, the firm has further expanded in Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia. As John Bicknell might say, the firm has ""built up a business"", based on those attributes of quality, balance and impact and on an unrelenting mission of achieving success for clients – a mission shared today by approximately 1000 lawyers worldwide.",,,https://www.twitter.com/gibsondunn,,"181,488"

It consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent (majority vote) of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices effectively have life tenure which terminates only upon death, resignation, retirement, and conviction on impeachment. The court meets in Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States Supreme Court building. The Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. With few exceptions, the life of a U.S. Supreme Court case begins when a lower court case ends since the Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeals. The losing party in a lower court case must request entry onto the court’s calendar. The justices then decide whether to hear the case, the crucial factor being whether the case can shed new light on an issue of constitutional law. The court hears about 100 of the 10,000 cases that compete for a spot on the court’s calendar each year. Once the court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from each side must submit written arguments. Each justice will typically choose a clerk to review the arguments and prepare a memo, outlining the issues the case presents. The lawyers for each side are informed the date of their oral arguments. Shortly before oral arguments, justices review the memos so that they can anticipate each party’s argument and the theories behind their reasoning. Each party receives half an hour for their oral arguments, including questions from the justices. The justices are seated in order of seniority with the Chief Justice seated in the center. Justices often question the lawyers as their arguments proceed. Supreme Court of U.S. was established in 1789 and is based in Washington, District of Columbia.",https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/85523/,,https://twitter.com/USSupremeCourt,https://www.facebook.com/SupremeCourtoftheUnitedStates/,"233,808"

With offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, we maintain a national and international practice. MTO's principal areas of practice include litigation, corporate, labor and employment, environmental, real estate, financial restructuring and tax.  MTO has purposefully maintained a low-leverage environment and eschewed the high-leverage model adopted by many firms. MTO believes their one-to-one overall partner-to-associate ratio instills a work ethic that results in a cost-effective approach for their clients. In every representation, their 200 lawyers are expected to make a difference in developing and implementing strategies to obtain the best results for the client.  In a survey conducted by The American Lawyer, clients said they called on MTO in “precedent-setting cases that require a creative mind.” Where resources are needed, the survey noted that we are able to deploy an “army of trial lawyers capable of waging war.”  MTO is involved in some of the most high-profile legal cases in the country and count among their clients Bank of America, Transocean, Edison International, Verizon, Rambus, Oaktree Capital Management, KB Home, LG Display, Yucaipa Cos. and Berkshire Hathaway. Descriptions of these and other representations can be found on their Practice and Industries pages.  In order to provide excellent service, MTO strives to hire only the most qualified and creative lawyers. MTO believes that clerkships provide valuable experience. In this regard, more than 70 percent of our attorneys served as law clerks to federal judges. Fifteen attorneys were clerks to U.S. Supreme Court Justices. Beyond clerkships, our attorneys also have experiences that bring an additional dimension to their client service. Many of MTO's litigators honed their courtroom skills while serving as assistant U.S. attorneys and a number of our lawyers have advanced degrees in relevant subject matter areas, including physics, engineering and medicine. MTO is proud to count among their lawyers one of the top 19 trial lawyers in the country as identified by Chambers USA, as well as one of the Daily Journal’s “Ten Top Lawyers of the Decade.”  MTO has been consistently ranked on The American Lawyer’s A-List since its inception in 2004, including four years in the top spot. This annual ranking of the nation’s elite law firms ranks on the basis of financial strength, diversity, pro bono work and attorney satisfaction.

Two things were necessary to accomplish this mission.  The first was having industry expertise from the perspective of a personal injury attorney to build the best directory.  The second was to leverage the power of technology to create a simple and seamless solution for attorneys, their staff and doctors.    As a practicing attorney, who has also received recognition as a Rising Star Super Lawyer in California, I realized time and again that there was no easy way for me or my colleagues to find doctors that worked on liens.  Besides Chiropractors, there was absolutely no practical way to find any other medical specialties on lien throughout the state.   Power Liens was born out of a desire to address this very need.  Today, less than two years later, there continues to be tremendous demand for our services by attorneys and their staff.  What previously took hours to complete, is now facilitated through our directory in a matter of minutes.  We now enjoy a loyal and highly satisfied customer base, and some of our users have even coined their own slogan for our Company – “created by an attorney for attorneys”.   Our success would not be possible without our dedication to our clients (screened and quality rated health care providers), who in turn provide exceptional service to their patients.

There were three founders: Paul Hyman, Jim Phelps, and Bob Dormer. They left a New York-based firm to create their own practice. The goal of the new firm was to provide service to clients regulated primarily by the Food and Drug Administration, the agency with which the three founders had extensive experience. When Steve McNamara joined the practice in 1984, the firm became known as Hyman, Phelps & McNamara. Later that year, the firm incorporated, and has since been known as Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, P.C. The founders intended to maintain the firm at a size to meet the needs of food and drug clients. Over the years, the size of the firm has grown considerably due to the ever-increasing needs of those clients. As government regulation of the food, dietary supplement, drug, biologic, medical device and cosmetic industries has escalated, our food and drug practice has expanded into many related subspecialties, including controlled substances, fraud and abuse, reimbursement and payor issues, and advertising and claims substantiation, to name a few. (To view a list of our specialty practice areas, see Practice Areas.) The backgrounds and experiences of our attorneys support the breadth of the firm's practice. Our attorneys have had experience in many branches of the federal government, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Justice (Office of Consumer Litigation), U.S. Attorneys Offices, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three of our attorneys have been general counsels in major pharmaceutical houses, and others have served in industry trade associations. Still others have scientific backgrounds in areas that complement our practice, such as clinical research and the practice of pharmacy. One member is a former judge, and several were law clerks. (To view the individual biographies, see Professionals ). Together the firm's attorneys bring a seasoned focus to the issues that confront food, dietary supplement, drug, biologic, medical device, and cosmetic companies. Further, in addressing clients' issues, we have a vast network of resources at our disposal to supplement our combined expertise. Because aspects of our regulatory practice often involve complex or novel scientific issues, we work collaboratively with physicians and consultants, as needed, who are able to provide targeted medical or scientific expertise to help accomplish the regulatory goals of our clients. In addition, we have longstanding relationships with regulatory counsel in foreign jurisdictions - including the European Union, Asia, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Australia - in which clients may seek to market their products, source ingredients or materials, hold clinical trials, or may otherwise require assistance. Our goal is to provide prompt and economical professional services suited to each client's specific needs. The firm's clients are as diverse as the regulatory issues they face. They range from individuals and start-up companies with no in-house legal staff to large multinational corporations. In addition, other law firms retain HPM to provide targeted expertise in food and drug law to assist their clients. HPM works to avoid legal problems when possible, and to help solve them when necessary.
