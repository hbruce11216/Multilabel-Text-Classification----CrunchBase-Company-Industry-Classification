Opened on August 4, 1996, The Soho Grand is located in the heart of SoHo, alongside world renowned art galleries, boutiques and restaurants. Undeterred that downtown’s SoHo district had been devoid of hotels for over a century, owners Leonard and Emanuel Stern, of Hartz Mountain Industries, developed their pioneering vision in, what is now, the city’s most sought after neighborhood. The result quickly became one of the world’s most celebrated boutique hotels and Soho Grand continues to be an integral part of the neighborhood’s fabric, home to savvy locals and sophisticated travelers alike. The Soho Grand’s unfailing ability to balance service and style has been the key to its success and continuously sets the highest standard amongst hotels of its kind. The hotel continues to receive accolades from both national and international publications; from Conde Nast Traveler’s coveted ‘Gold List’ as one of the world’s best places to stay and being voted one of the top 100 places to stay worldwide. New York magazine cited the Soho Grand as the “top boutique hotel without attitude.” Interior designer Nate Berkus, nationally featured Soho Grand as one of his favorite places to stay on Oprah’s ‘Best Of’ show.  Parallel to its innovative vision is the Soho Grand’s leadership in design; Helpern Architects constructed the hotel’s intentionally nondescript exterior and is a reflection of the evolution of SoHo’s architectural heritage over the past 125 years. Celebrated interior designer Bill Sofield, of Studio Sofield, has collaborated with the hotel from its inception and the interior mirrors the stylistic trends visible in the neighborhood today. All of the materials used in construction are consistent with the existing character of the community and continues to elevate and embody the classic SoHo aesthetic. With the recent introduction of the Club Room, and new custom suites on the 16th floor, the Soho Grand succeeds in updating its offerings in a way that exudes luxury yet stays true to the hotel’s core aesthetic. Soho Grand has 353 custom hotel rooms and Suites and 2 sprawling Penthouse Lofts that reflect the history and character of the neighborhood. The Hotel stands 17-stories offering stunning views of downtown Manhattan. The beautifully designed guestrooms and suites feature custom furnishings and high end fixtures, Egyptian cotton linen, Frette bathrobes. Bath amenities are from New York’s original apothecary, Kiehl’s Since 1851. Having been the first hotel to use their renowned products, the Soho Grand is proud to revisit the heritage brand this fall. Each room is equipped with flat-screen plasma televisions and iPod dock and speakers. Original artwork is provided by the Howard Greenberg Gallery. Suites are equipped with 21-inch iMacs and an iPad pre-loaded with the Hotel’s carefully curated downtown Neighborhood Guide.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/sohograndhotel/about/,,https://twitter.com/SohoGrandHotel,https://www.facebook.com/SohoGrandHotel/,"359,524"

As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods.  Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).",https://www.linkedin.com/company/armita-x,,,https://www.facebook.com/Armita-X-178962392726604/,"401,642"

Built on a solid foundation of superior personal service to each and every guest, Jameson Inns quickly expanded to become one of the leading hotel chains in the Southeast. In August of 1999, the prototype of a new generation of Jameson Inns was opened in Rome, Georgia. This new interior corridor design incorporated the same familiar southern colonial motif and well-known Jameson amenities with the conveniences of a contemporary business class hotel. Within two years, twenty-five additional interior corridor hotels were added to the family. This dramatic growth has been supported by an ever-expanding legion of loyal guests who return year after year.",,,https://twitter.com/JamesonInns,https://www.facebook.com/JamesonInns/,"849,611"
