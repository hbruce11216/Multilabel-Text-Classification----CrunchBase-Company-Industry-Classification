We offer value-driven products and tools that solve a broad range of IT management challenges—whether those challenges are related to networks, servers, applications, storage, virtualization, cloud, or development operations. If there is a piece of IT infrastructure anywhere in the world where performance matters, SolarWinds provides the technology to manage it. Whether you’re an army of one managing a small environment, an MSP responsible for multiple customers, part of an IT team managing an enterprise, or you’ve migrated to the cloud—if you care about IT performance—SolarWinds has powerful, easy-to-use, and affordable products to help you manage it. We distinguish ourselves by refusing to accept the status quo established by most technology vendors. Face it: The vast majority of IT management tools today are difficult to use, expensive, and really don’t address the realities of today’s real-world IT challenges. Too many IT pros have resigned themselves to accept the frustration. But we don’t think enterprise-grade software or services have to be so complex. We think that great technology not only makes it much easier to manage infrastructure, but empowers IT to actually delight end users. At SolarWinds, we’re fanatical about putting users first in everything we do. We strive every day to deliver powerful functionality that’s easy to use with one of the fastest and longest-lasting ROIs in the market. As a result, SolarWinds is one of the world’s most award-winning, peer-recommended and continuously-licensed product families year after year. Our approach is to deliver unexpected simplicity and redefine the management and monitoring expectations for all aspects of IT, MSPs, and DevOps pros. Simply put, we work to: Eliminate the complexity found in traditional enterprise software and services—we make it easy to find, buy, deploy and maintain solutions, regardless of an organization’s size. Connect with our community—we interact daily with our large, global user community to guide our product development and strategy, and foster an environment where users with even the most complex IT challenges quickly connect with experts who love to help. Constantly evolve our products—we ensure our software is on point to meet the most important problems that IT pros, MSPs, and DevOps engineers have today, and continues to deliver increasing value over the lifetime of ownership. Our company was built by IT administrators and senior systems engineers who know what it takes to manage today’s dynamic IT environments. They combine this expertise with a deep connection to the IT community to create IT management products that are effective, accessible and easy to use. The result? IT management software that works for you—and that delivers on our promise of unexpected simplicity.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/solarwinds,,http://twitter.com/solarwinds,http://www.facebook.com/SolarWinds,2

OneLogin,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onelogin,http://onelogin.com,"Big Data, Cloud Security, Enterprise Software, Identity Management, Information Technology, SaaS, Software","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",OneLogin is a cloud identity and access management solution that enables enterprises to secure all apps for their users on all devices.,"The proliferation of digital access has made the world more connected than ever before. Trust is the common thread that connects today’s elastic enterprise--trust that your identity solution will be there when you need it most and trust that your end-users know their information is safe.  The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform is the identity foundation to build secure, scalable and smart trusted experiences that connect people with technology. With OneLogin, seamlessly manage digital identities for your workforce and customers, so you can focus on what matters most--growing your business.  With OneLogin’s complete solution, you can easily connect all of your applications, leverage our proprietary machine learning to identify and analyze potential threats and act quickly using contextual authentication requirements. Secure: Security is the cornerstone of trust. It’s the confidence that your identity solution is reliable and always-on, so you can focus on what matters--growing the business. The OneLogin platform protects your organization against threats by securing and centralizing your applications, devices, and end-users all in one, easy-to-access place. Additionally, through our advanced machine learning capabilities, OneLogin can deliver real-time threat intelligence to help automate the process of keeping your business secure.  Scalable: The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform was built for performance and reliability at scale. With a wide breadth of extensible functionality, we can expand and retract according to the changing needs of your business. Through our enterprise-grade change management solutions, like our Enterprise Sandbox and API Access, you can quickly test large-scale changes before going live in your production instance. Our high availability Login Clusters elastically load-balance providing reliable, continuous service when you need it the most. That means if your database is impacted for any reason, your OneLogin environment won’t be impacted.   Smart: The risk of cyberattacks continue to increase as perpetrators look for smarter and less-detectable ways to circumvent security solutions. And for today’s businesses, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to implement solutions that evolve as the methods of attackers evolve. Although Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has become the defacto tool to protect end-user credentials and your business’ sensitive data, static authentication simply isn’t enough. Additionally, as identity management solutions seek to find more ways to secure the enterprise, user experience is often sacrificed, causing end-users to become increasingly agitated, often seeking out ways to evade having to authenticate several times.  Simple: Ease-of-use and speed-of-adoption are imperative to ensuring your identity and access management strategy is effectively rolled out across your organization. And in order to achieve that the solution you choose must be simple. And that means simple for you and simple for your users.  OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Citizen, Evernote, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Stitch Fix, and Uber. Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 6,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits *Developer toolkits & APIs DIFFERENTIATORS: Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include: OneLogin Access: OneLogin Access extends the reach of the OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform™ to applications hosted on-premises and in public or private clouds. We bring the benefits of the cloud to you: simplified administration reduced IT costs, improved security, and enhanced user experience. OneLogin Access eliminates aging Access Management tools that are complex, expensive, and disconnected from modern SaaS environments. Through the OneLogin portal, users enjoy a simple, consistent experience with single-click access to SaaS and on-premise applications from any device. OneLogin SmartFactor AuthenticationTM: As part of our Trusted Experience Platform™, SmartFactor Authentication leverages our Vigilance AI™ risk score to dynamically adjust authentication requirements in real-time based on the level of risk for each login, balancing security with usability. OneLogin’s SmartFactor Authentication uses machine learning to analyze a broad range of inputs, such as location, device, and user behavior, to calculate a risk score and determine the most appropriate security action to take for each login attempt. Depending on the detected level of risk, SmartFactor Authentication adjusts the number of authentication factors needed to log in. OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Cloud RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Merakiwireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short. ACQUISITIONS:  In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. RECOGNITION: In November 2019, OneLogin was named a 2019 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Access Management Software.
