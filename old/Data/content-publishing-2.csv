It is an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing how sound for video is produced, refined and delivered. Our powerful AI engine notices users’ likes and dislikes, so over time, Audio Design Desk gets to know each user’s taste. It comes bundled with over 20,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, which makes our groundbreaking technology possible. Audio Design Desk’s intuitive and innovative content creation tools empower filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software. Here’s how it works: Every sound in the add.app library is assigned identifying characteristics and carries an embedded sync point, which means that as sounds are previewed and chosen, they automatically land on the timeline in the exact right position relative to the video. The user simply imports a video file into the app and presses keys on their keyboard—H for hits, R for rises, D for drones, or users can assign sets of sounds to their numeric keys. The user can then strike the keys to position sound elements in real-time while watching the video playback—in effect, using the QWERTY keyboard like a Smart Sampler. For users who would rather select audio manually, add.app can search, audition and place sounds right from the timeline, completely eliminating the need to parse through libraries, import sounds and then find where they sync. Once a composition is set, add.app understands where sound connects to video and, by adjusting replacement criteria such as intensity, complexity, genre or feel, Audio Design Desk can use its Sonic Intelligence™ to instantly turn a single composition into infinite alternates without losing sync. Perhaps the most mind-blowing of all, add.app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and has built the foundation for Machine Learning (ML) to understand which sounds a user likes and which sounds they reject so, over time, add.app will learn and adjust to its user’s taste.  add.app seamlessly integrates with the industry’s leading NLE software, including Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, Apple Logic, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Pro Tools, and Avid Media Composer, with frame.io integration coming soon. add.app also works with hardware controllers like the Elgato Stream Deck, which makes the process of adding sound effects via keystrokes even easier.  Audio Design Desk is a SXSW Innovation Awards Finalist and winner of a 2020 NAB Show / Pro Sound News Best of Show Award. Already being used by editors at Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Originals, add.app is fueling creativity everywhere. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Academy Award-nominated editor Matthew Cooke: “There isn't another piece of software that allows you to instantly create at this level of professionalism.” Sound Effects Editor of ZERO DARK THIRTY Jamie Hardt: “Audio Design Desk is the tool I’ve been looking for my entire career.” Mix Magazine: “Expertly designed,” “groundbreaking application that significantly speeds up the act of accurately adding sound effects and music to picture” ProAudioFiles: “A new paradigm for audio post production” Redshark News: “A breathtakingly effective idea for sound designers” Pro Video Coalition: “Represents an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation—or DAW—that uses AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, editors, sound designers and creators to produce cinema-quality sound in seconds""",https://linkedin.com/audiodesigndesk,,https://twitter.com/audiodesigndesk,https://facebook.com/audiodesigndesk

For authors today, creating digital versions of their books is both a costly and timely process. The options to create visually compelling, cross-platform storybooks requires either well-honed programming skills or the funding necessary to hire expensive developers to create these applications. Authorly founder Chris Whitman was one of these developers. After being hired by New York Times Bestselling author Carl Sams to convert the popular children's book Stranger in the Woods into an interactive app, he decided there must be an easier way. Whitman therefore began to build disruptive software that empowers authors to create their own apps. The result is Authorly: a platform perfect for children’s authors, comic book artists, visual novelists, or anyone with a great illustrated story to tell.

An RFP is what agencies use to assess your project and then provide you with a proposal. At Big Drop, we receive tons of RFPs, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies–some are good, some are bad and some we no longer speak of. What we’ve laid out, is how to prepare an RFP for your website and how to create a great one. After all, the more thorough you can be with your RFP, the more accurate your proposal will be.   When you need a website, the first thing you do is put together a web redesign request for proposal. Submitting your RFP to multiple agencies is common and always a good idea — it’s how you get an idea of what it will really take to bring your project and vision to life. After you’ve submitted your request, agencies will respond with a proposed solution that outlines the scope of work, timeline, and cost for your website. Typically, this exchange is followed up by a brief phone call and a question and answer session. Think of your RFP as a first impression to potential agency partners. A great RFP sets the stage for a great partnership. A great RFP is clear, concise and gets straight to the point. You don’t have to have the technical know-how to create an RFP. In fact, most of the best RFPs we receive have no mention of code or technical jargon (we hear enough developer talk on a daily basis). If you know what integrations you want to use (MailChimp, HubSpot, Marketo) then list them in your RFP email to vendors. If not, forget it. You don’t have to have all of the answers. After all, that’s why you’re hiring an agency in the first place, so leave it to the pros to figure it out.",,,https://twitter.com/WebDeve91266091,https://www.facebook.com/Web-Developer-Boston-393835187760473/

Problem: There is no user friendly, free, public facing platform that aggregates videos by location from social media. (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, Periscope). Centric App allows users to organically discover videos of what’s happening around them and see what’s going on outside the “echo chamber” - of their own networks. At the same time creators need a way to connect organically and share video content with audiences that does not involve infiltrating their social networks or gaming social platforms algorithms. The result is a dis-connect, with users missing out on what’s happening around them and creators producing huge amounts of content that is not reaching new viewers, growing audiences or monetizing. In reality it is gathering dust. Solution: Centric App allows anyone to quickly discover videos being published around them, whatever the channel or platform. They can find out what’s happening locally, discover new content, share and comment. They can follow, engage and connect with creators and publishers on the source platform. Bottom line is Centric matches video content by location, just like Tinder, bringing audiences and videos together. Centric shares undiscovered content with a new audience and grows reach for content producers. ￼",https://www.linkedin.com/company/centric-app,,http://twitter.com/CentricApp,https://www.facebook.com/CentricApp/

PROBLEM •	Online shopping does not provide customers a way to experience the product like they can at the store. •	Written content is not well suited for a mobile-first, social-sharing world. •	Retailers and brands want video because they know their shoppers want it (over 80% of all Internet traffic will be video by 2019 and because it sells more product). •	Retailers and brands don’t have enough video because producing, gathering or managing enough video to meet customer demand is logistically and financially impossible. SOLUTION •	Criteek enhances the shopping experience and engages shoppers with personalized customer-generated video directly on the product page, leading to increased sales. •	Criteek patent-pending technology streamlines the process of activating customers, then gathering, screening, hosting, managing and streaming their video to the product page and social networks, and sharing it among marketing partners, through an easily-managed online dashboard.  •	Clients get a sustainable, scaled pipeline of credible video from their customers and their partners for the cost of moderation. •	Criteek collects proprietary data with insights into the shopping experience, how shoppers consume video and how video can be used to increase sales. WHY NOW? Brands and retailers can no longer compete on price and product differentiation alone. Now, they are competing squarely on customer experience.  Video is the immediately scalable medium that transforms the customer experience.  Recognizing this, Amazon has begun to gather and stream video reviews from their customers.  However, their tech is proprietary. Criteek now provides brands and retailers with a way to remain competitive. TECHNOLOGY 	Tech is patent-pending. 	Tech is difficult to build. 	The platform creates value by:  -- helping clients increase shopper engagement and sales; -- providing an interdependent video content network among those clients; -- producing a proprietary data set around video & eCommerce. TEAM Scott Randall, CEO 	Founded BrandGames, the first company to leverage videogames as media 	Marketed to Fortune 500 companies, including Pizza Hut, GAP, TacoBell, & Pepsi 	Sold BrandGames in 2001 	Built the digital & ecommerce infrastructure for a $220mm children’s brand 	Marketing thought leader – presented at global conferences (Milken Global Conference) 	Award winning marketer - Marketing Technology Award, WebAwards, Art Direction’s Creativity Award, Davey Award, Communicator Award Rahul Khosla, CTO 	Founder - eDynamic: marketing tech agency 	ex-Accenture consultant and digital marketing executive 	Advised and consulted Fortune 500 firms on marketing technology 	Marketing automation expert Kyle Wilkinson, COO 	BI & marketing analytics at GILT & BTR 	Customer data modeling expert 	Derivatives modeler & trader 	Built & managed financial risk models COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 	Criteek’s patent-pending technology has the ability to capture, moderate, stream & syndicate video across multiple domains. 	Criteek creates an eco-system of video content sharing: --video is easily acquired from customers, partners & social networks and creates a content-sharing network. 	Criteek creates platform dependency for users   --clients depend on video-sharing content pipeline. 	Criteek produces data & insight: --the Criteek platform gives us a proprietary view of the use, sharing & performance of video for use in increasing client sales.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/criteek/,,https://www.twitter.com/criteekit,https://www.facebook.com/criteek

THE BEGINNING Crossfield began as a mobile gaming start-up called PrePlay, which developed web and mobile applications that enabled sports fans to make predictions about every play of every game.   PrePlay was the #1 live sports prediction game from 2010-2015 and spanned across professional baseball, football, hockey and tennis.  Over that time, our users made over 50 million predictions across all of our applications. JOINING A NEW TEAM PrePlay was acquired by FanVision Entertainment (FVE) in September of 2014.  FVE added PrePlay’s management and software expertise to further deliver on its mission to enhance the spectator experience. THE TRANSITION FanVision Entertainment is one of a portfolio of companies within the Related Sports and Entertainment (RSE) Ventures family of companies.  When sister company Relevent Sports, the operators of the International Champions Cup, called us about developing their new website, the transition from mobile gaming experts to work-for-hire software development agency began. A NEW NAME After launching the International Champions Cup site and signing Bleacher Report as a partner for its March Madness Bracket Challenge Game, we set out to rebrand the agency to reflect our broader range of capabilities.   Prediction gaming (including live prediction, bracket and streak games) remains a core competency, but we built a team that has decades of combined creative, development and digital strategy experience that spans far beyond gaming.  PrePlay as a self-published product was shut down, and Crossfield Digital, the agency, was born in October of 2015.",https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10256789/,,https://twitter.com/crxssfield,https://www.facebook.com/pg/CrossfieldDigital/

Learning happens best when there is robust dialogue among diverse groups with differing backgrounds and opinions. Rather than being another outlet focused on ‘Breaking News,’ dramatization, and sensationalism, Curiosity Shots intends on bridging cultural divides by fostering communication. Our writers include the likes of students, members of the working public, elite journalists, celebrities, and artists. We are fostering a community that includes people from all walks of life in order to inform and mend wounds. Until all voices are heard, not just media, financial, and political elites, only division will persist. This is why our team leaves out no group and involves all people in the conversation under one roof.   Educational Content Created To Inspire   In an age defined by our ability to interact with the entire known cosmos with a mere touch of a tablet, all citizens have become perpetual students. It is for this reason that Curiosity Shots believes the time has arrived to introduce a reinvigorated model of education. One that not only meets the demands of our time, but pioneers advancements in integrating technology into the learning process. The assembly line model of education that persists to this day was designed to produce factory workers for an export-oriented economy. This is why students are force-fed information via a one-size-fits-all approach without consideration for individual differences and what it means to truly learn. Curiosity Shots offers an alternative with new, stimulating, video-based educational content designed to create lifelong learners.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/curiosityshots/,,https://twitter.com/Curiosity_Shots,https://www.facebook.com/CurisosityShots/

Families share content privately.","While honeymooning in 2005, my wife and I came up with the idea for eFamily.com. We knew we wanted to start our own family and share those special moments with those closest to us, many of whom happened to be thousands of miles away. Also during that time, we were selling the first consumer web-based business that I co-founded (3GUpload.com), so it was the perfect moment to combine our love of family and business. Fast-forwarding to 2010 (after a few attempts to build our own solution), we had an opportunity to expand the eFamily service with the acquisition of Famiva.com. At that point, we were able to realize our original vision of family sites with photos, videos, status updates, shared calendar, family tree, and custom family domains. Our company grew, but – like nearly every online business – we started seeing strong demand for mobile versions of our service. And so in 2013, we decided to purchase the software assets from a company called Origami. We loved Origami’s software solution including the mobile applications – arguably the best in the marketplace. Our plan with the Origami software acquisition is to create an even more powerful eFamily service. We’ll take the lessons we’ve learned from our experience in the family space, and we’ll apply those to this powerful new platform moving forward. So in closing, a lot of people wonder why we’ve been diligently pursuing this business for over 8 years. It may seem illogical to most, but there is a deeper reason and motivation than just business success and financial rewards. We truly believe a site like eFamily.com can change the world for the better. When we look back on our lives, we will be able to say that we helped families stay connected and celebrate life – no matter the distance.  eFamily.com believe that at the root of positive change in society is a group of healthy families, and part of staying healthy as a family is communication and celebrating life. As a result of our efforts, we hope to help this world become a better place.

How Does it Work? As currently designed in the technical drawings and 3-D models, the app has unique features not presently available in the marketplace.  Although the programming has not yet been developed and is still in the developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows: The primary function of Eye Phone is to help the user better see, read, and type on their phone or tablet. The user will be able to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight. Since the user will not always be the same distance from their phone or tablet, the user can have several different focus settings saved to the app. This will allow the user to quickly and easily adjust the screen for their eyes. The user will have the option to focus the screen three different ways, by prescription strength, an eye chart or manually adjusting the screen. What Problem(s) Does it Solve? The unique features of this app will provide the following benefits for all consumers: • Allows the user to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight • Saves the user time and energy by not having to squint to read their phone or tablet • Gives the user 3 different options to adjust the screen Mr. O’ Connor envisions his product appealing to multitudes of consumers worldwide who use     their “smart phones” not only for communication but also for innovative solutions. The markets are extensive for an ingenious app like Eye Phone; Google Play and iTunes are the most popular app stores in the primary market and are the ideal places to market this app. However, for the Android version of the app there are several new stores popping all over the cyber world such as, AppsLib, Samsung Apps, F-Droid, Slide ME, GetJar, and Amazon App Store for Android. Mr. O’ Connor wishes to leave the market open for subsequent variances and possibilities that could improve the feasibility and marketability of his product.",,,,

The video sections are cleaned and then converted to a format of the user’s choosing. SproutConverter is essential software for both professional media conversion studios and home users.  SproutConverter is an indispensable program to use in combination with iMovie or Final Cut Pro to batch clean your digitized VHS, Hi8, 8mm, Video8 tapes, and more, removing video distortion, video noise, blank spaces, and static.

The cleaned versions can be saved in many popular video file formats — SproutConverter automates the entire process, saving you time and money!  SproutConverter works by comparing your video to a library of specifically chosen video and movie distortion filters. Advanced users may also specify particular frames in their videos for SproutConverter to use as additional examples of distortion.  -----------------------------------  Multimedia video files sometimes contain blank spaces, static, noise, artifacts, distortion, feedback, and other glitches, which occur in-between the normal video segments. These blank or noise affected sections cause the video to play back with gaps and stutter.

Features:  ☆ Patent pending cleaning method to remove distortion from videos.  ☆ Convert your files using popular file formats and codecs, then automatically add them to iTunes.  ☆ Automatically combine your movies in to a single video after filtering and conversion.  ☆ Customizable filter library which allows you to add your own images as filters to the conversion process.  ☆ Batch conversion enables you to convert multiple files at once.  ☆ Includes Instant-Save for any file in MOV format.

It was all too often we heard feedback regarding the dull, painstaking and time consuming processes common to their workflows. These individuals were spending countless hours and effort capturing images – only to be left creating mediocre results that still required additional attention in editing software. The need for a refined workflow that would allow individuals to efficiently capture, edit and process high quality images was apparent. The information search began and ended soon after. The conclusion being existing photography software’s were piecemeal, required skilled users and didn’t cater specifically to business photography applications. This led to the development of Shutter Stream Product Photography Software – the world’s first fully integrated image capture, editing and processing software designed for in-house photography. Soon after the release of Shutter Stream, we received feedback from customers telling us the software was perfect for 360 Product Photography. We tailored the software to further enhance picture taking and imaging capabilities for the 360 imaging workflow and integrated a 360 Product View Creator Software. The result being Shutter Stream 360 Product Photography Software. Understanding our customers’ requirements and delivering products to meet these needs has been critical to Iconasys’ success. We aim to continually improve our product offerings to fill the needs of our underserved target market – businesses who require high quality and high volume in house photography.

Over the years, ICV has grown to become a recognized leader in live event video production and webcasting. Corporate and commercial video production and video studio rentals to the San Francisco Bay Area and the Silicon Valley media market rounds out ICV's services.  ICV remains focused on providing personalized attention to every client and their projects. And thanks to the talented people that have become the ICV family, it's worked out great. In 1999 we designed and built our Studio and moved out of our small rented space. The Pleasanton facility was designed to be an open and spacious 8500 sq. ft office / studio with open offices, lots of creative space and something most video production companies do NOT have ""in-house""; our own 2500 sq. ft. video production studio sound stage. Our full Cyc walls and Lighting Grid make green screen compositing easy. San Francisco video production companies, and San Jose video producers use our video studio for their productions. When they're shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles video production companies, advertising agencies and producers use our video studio, audio booth, High Definition HK3800 video cameras, our HD-SDI Mobile video flypacks, edit on one of our 3 Final Cut/Premier Pro editing suites or utilize our creative web design / writing / graphics / production crew and staff to complete their projects. Using their proprietary live webcasting platform, V3, ICV provides not only the video production for any size event, but also provides a custom branded event or company media portal using any web address, with secure, responsive video players with chat, Q and A and synchronized slides along with full HD video streaming. Using V3 ICV can build and launch an integrated media portal in minutes and be streaming live on location anywhere immediately.  Content hosting, all A/V and video staff and gear and of course the video streaming using a global CDN is all managed by ICV. No customer staff or resources are required. Corporate staff can quickly learn how to build and deploy event or company meeting webcast portals themselves within V3. Once the media portal for the webcast has been published, a request is sent for ICV to staff the event and manage the complete video production.  Tools for management of live events and conferences covers user registration and management, speaker bios and photos, customizable agendas and session descriptions. The V3 platform provides monetization tools such as display advertising, and e-commerce sales supporting all major payment gateways to sell attendance of  both live webcast events or to view on-demand archives of content at a single URL, within a web site that the client can control.  Producers that wish to sell webcasting can white label V3 and deploy and manage the webcasts themselves within V32 in their own separate company portal where they can manage multiple customer webcast profiles while utilizing ICV's video production and webcast encoding services to resell webcast production. Since the beginning, we’ve used state-of-the-art technology and innovative design concepts to create compelling videos, effective web content and exciting digital media. Our ability to go anywhere in the world on a moments notice and produce webcast events and web portals with 100% confidence has gained us the trust of our clients. Because we refuse to be pushed into a niche, ICV has evolved into a unique full-service interactive media studio offering video production, webcasting and web development. We use all of those skills to help our clients market and develop their online strategies. From our company built and owned interactive media studio in Pleasanton, CA we serve the San Francisco Bay Area, San Jose, Silicon Valley and beyond.

By combining advanced image search technology, digital image recognition, and a secure shareable online image format, IPShare™, with a growing platform of over 450,000 members, Image Protect is at the forefront for the protection and monetization of global copyright.  Image Protect is a revolutionary content rights platform, utilizing blockchain technology to manage, protect and monetize digital media for content producers of all levels, publishers, and advertisers. Our embeddable in-image advertising format, IPShare™, lies at the heart of our mission.  As an option to the Standard DMCA Takedown notice, Image Protect has developed the IPShare™ technology - an interactive online image format with in-image advertising, hot links, social sharing and dynamic messaging. This image format makes it impossible to steal the image by either downloading or screenshot/screen printing. This new model allows us to sell in-image advertising, which we share a portion of the proceeds to the creator and the publisher. The model works similar to the DMCA Takedown notice, but instead of requesting a removal of the content, we ask to replace the image with our proprietary embed code image. It is a win-win for all parties!",http://www.linkedin.com/company/clear-arts---imageprotect,,http://twitter.com/ImageProtect,http://www.facebook.com/ImageProtect
