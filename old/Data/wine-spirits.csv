Dented Brick has utilized web based sales programming and big data analytics to achieve strategic wholesale partnerships and distribution in 11 states offering 7 products. Our go to market strategy is based on the concept of brand activation at the on-premise point of sale. We have developed a web based portal to deliver utilitarian brand items to accounts. Our sales team is offered monthly sales programs to incentivise them to sell our brand, and the portal allows the sales member to deliver branded items to an account during a sales call as an incentive to the account to purchase our items. On-premise brand activation lead to off-premise sales. Federal law requires suppliers of alcohol contract distributors to sell their product to retailers. This is an impediment to customers wanting Craft brands. Due to mass consolidation of distribution, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Small brands with distribution use sale forces that sell the equivalent mega brand. Small brands do not have the budget to activate consumers in the traditional mega brand campaign. The market share of U.S. Craft spirits reached 3.0% in value in 2015, up from 1.1% in 2010. This places 97% of the market in the hands of very large corporations like Beam Suntory. These mega brand competitors utilize massive budgets and national agency advertising and events. In addition, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Our proprietary web portal and on-premise brand activation strategy allows us to end run this barrier, and go direct to the millennial consumer. Distributors are receptive to marketing offered by all suppliers. DBD is developing a web based platform to assist distributors with brand activation at on-premise locations through direct delivery of point of sale branding merchandise, a low-cost method to compete with the more expensive traditional branding campaigns used by mega brands. This method will offer a sales channel to the craft buyer and eventual crossover to off premise sales. Utilizing our proprietary data compilation tool, DBD can identify trends in the market on a monthly basis. We will be able to target trends at a state by state or national level in categories and brands to steer our product development and marketing. Our proprietary DentedBrick.com web portal allows distribution sales personnel to design custom point of sale merchandise on-line on-site, directly activating consumers at the point of sale. DBD is a national wholesale distribution company, and has contracted with Aurora Wine and Spirits, a national wholesaler with contacts and knowledge needed to assist DBD gain distribution in all targeted markets. The DBD on-premise support program will drive customer retention. The company value will increase exponentially with repeat customers in a multi-state distribution environment. The U.S. distilled spirits market in 2017 equated to $78.07 bn in sales, with the largest sub-category of spirits is vodka at 34%, then whiskey at 24%, and rum at 12%. The spirits industry has experienced steady growth over the last ten years. The spirits segment volume has been growing at a CAGR of 2% over the last 10 years. Smaller brands have been gaining share. The non-top 5 brands gained between 12 and 37 % over a 20 year period and between 2 and 9% in the last 5 years. Craft products like Tito’s Vodka and Hendrick’s Gin have become attractive brands. Millennials are driving the shift to Craft, using their purchasing power to disrupt the market. Surveys show Millennials drink more different types of spirits (vodka, rum, tequila and whiskey) than other generations. Often, as is the case with gin, new infusions that may have been impossible to market in the past are quickly becoming millennial mainstays.

We currently provide this service in California, and are underway in our plans to make it available in new markets in the near future. We started off as one of the first companies authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct commercial drone operations to provide crop scouting services for California vineyards, and have since grown to the point where the platform and software we built to serve our own customers has been used by drone operators on five continents to serve local growers.

He has successfully led multidisciplinary teams in both his civilian and military careers and has routinely been entrusted with assets valued at over $200 million and the completion of multi-million-dollar projects. He has identified and solved complex and evolving regulatory and technical issues that led to a six-fold increase in mission capability by defining and implementing new programs and policies. After separating from the military, he gained experience in the startup world as an analyst for Tech Coast Angels and earned his MBA from the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, building on credentials that include a BA in economics from Columbia University and an MA in International Relations from American Military University.   Vice President of Agriculture, Robert “Bob” Starnes, joins the company with a renowned record of developing and applying innovative agriculture technology in world-class academic institutions as well as successful commercial ventures. Before joining the company, Bob was the Senior Superintendent of Agriculture at UC Davis in the Entomology Department for 15 years. While there, he managed a research lab that studied integrated pest management and remote sensing in agriculture and also founded Shale Peak Horticulture, a company offering customized biological pest management solutions to growers as an alternative to using pesticides.

He has Masters Degrees in management from ESEC Barcelona and Toulouse Business School and is an alum of Start-Up Chile, where he met the UAV-IQ team. Originally from France and fluent in three languages, he has spent the last 10 years working in agriculture focusing on developing new technologies in India, Argentina, California, and Chile. He is now based out of Barcelona, Spain where he is focused on building awareness for UAV-IQ’s services and preparing for expansion into the EU.

Dan Schweiker and John Martinson wanted to disrupt the iced tea business. Low-quality teas that were the norm, just didn't cut it. So they went to work. With tenacious spirits and the help of new, emerging tea brewing technology, Dan and John embarked on a mission to make and distribute the first-ever gourmet, fresh-brewed iced teas for restaurants. After mixing and tasting numerous different tea leaf combinations, they hit on the perfect combination for iced black tea. So they started blending and packaging it from Martinson's garage and distributing it themselves around the state. Three years later, Rommie Flammer, a plucky, local high-schooler joined the company and began moving up. And here we are, 32+ years later with our founders, still driven by that same optimism and tenacity to create the best tasting teas you'll ever experience.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/china-mist-tea-company,,https://twitter.com/chinamisttea,https://www.facebook.com/chinamisticedteacompany,"349,637"

The company’s brand, Cotton & Reed, represents a portfolio of experimental spirits using natural ingredients and innovative distillation techniques. As consumers become increasingly focused on product origins, with movements like farm-to-table, Cotton & Reed is bringing this approach to the spirits world by distilling local, sometimes hand-foraged plants. BRAND: Cotton & Reed is named for our cofounders in the long tradition of eponymy in spirits. The name also calls to mind the verdant intersection of agriculture and nature at which our products sit. “Cotton” represents carefully cultivated plants like corn and wheat that form the basis of many of our spirits; wild-growing “reed” represents the more natural and unknown aspects of our products and marketing imagery. Our name simultaneously describes the origins of our company and our natural products as spirits consumers value origin stories and authenticity. MARKET: The craft spirits market is booming. Industry analysts expect producer revenue in the craft distillery market to grow at a 15-25% CAGR for the next 10-20 years.

WineLog's recommendation system allows users to compare their recorded comments and ratings to those of other WineLog users.

We have evolved from a small company into what we are today - the highest quality and most fun rafting company on the American River.  Our rafting and adventure trips reflect what we are passionate about. To date we have taken over 300,000 people down the American River and with 85% of our clients returning year after year, we must be doing something right! Many clients have expressed their amazement that a rafting trip entails so much more than just going down a river.  Rafting has long been plagued by the myth that it is dangerous, extreme and only for adrenaline junkies. Rafting is our profession, so we take it seriously. We are serious about safety, about good food, good times and very serious about fun! Our biggest safety feature are our world-class, certified, professional guides – you will appreciate the difference that they make especially with great attitudes and lots of character! We have an exceptional safety record on and off the river, and we like keeping it that way. We have three different rivers and three levels of adventure to choose from. We offer trips to suit all ages and abilities - it is not about fitness, it is about fun. Our youngest clients are the 6 year olds we take every day on the South Fork, and our most mature was a 76 year old on the North Fork!  This year American Whitewater Expeditions celebrates its 35th year as the premier whitewater rafting company in California on the American River. If you have been with us before, we look forward to seeing you again, if you have never been with us before, then come check out why were are the best. If you have never rafted before, we guarantee you will have a ton of fun and keep coming back for more!

Across America, the craft beer industry is flourishing!  Washington State, most notably Seattle, is a top 5 craft beer market  that is under supplied with local lagers, ranking 11th as a state in breweries per capita. Most beer served in the US today is a lager style, pilsner, however, most craft beer is focused on ale styles.  Ales are a flavorful and bold contrast to lagers, but are certainly not intended to be crisp & easy drinking like pilsners. ECB makes craft lager beer for those who want it all, flavorful & easy drinking! ECB primarily targets the young and social crowd, individuals with an active social life, and often stressful professional life, who frequent a wide range of venues for entertainment including, restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts, outdoor activities and various community events.  ECB has some exciting goals for the next year! We currently offer a year-around lager, and two of four planned seasonal lagers. Our year-around lager is the only style available today in 16oz aluminum cans. The plan for the next year is to release the final two seasonal lagers and put all four of the seasonal lagers into cans. We'll then release a variety pack of ten 16oz cans that includes all five different beers styles and 4-packs of the individual style when in season. ECB currently contracts the large production batches of beer with another local craft brewery in Western Washington. This allows ECB to better focus resources on building demand for our beers, instead of investing in supply assets that make them. In the next five years, we aspire to reach 15k barrels of annual production, qualifying us a regional craft-brewery. At these production volumes, it'll make sense for ECB to either sell it's brands to a larger brewer, or to build-in it's own facility, so to recapture the production margin for our investors.",http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=110365392,,http://twitter.com/emeraldcitybeer,http://www.facebook.com/emeraldcitybeer,"759,735"
