zyBooks,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zybooks,http://www.zybooks.com,"E-Learning, Education, Publishing","Content and Publishing, Education, Media and Entertainment, Software",zyBooks publishes interactive textbooks that utilizes animations and embedded tools.,"zyBooks was started in 2012 by Smita Bakshi and Frank Vahid. Frank is a Computer Science and Engineering professor at the University of California, Riverside, and Smita, prior to her 10 years in the high-tech industry, and was a UC Davis Electrical Computer Engineering professor.We started zyBooks to help college STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) students graduate. More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.  Professors include Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), and Andre Knoesen & Raj Amirtharajah (UC Davis). Starting with just a handful of universities in 2012, our computer science and engineering zyBooks are now used at over 200 colleges and universities and a few dozen high schools.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/zyante,,https://twitter.com/zybooks,https://www.facebook.com/zyBooks/

Their aim is to optimize the advertisement units of your website. They attempt to capitalize on a primary shortcoming of contextual advertisements: After their initial placement into text by publishers, formatting, placement, and layout is seldom altered and tested to see if response can be improved. YieldBuild is able to automatically optimize your siteâ€™s ad spots with the most profitable combination of ad layout, style, and network. The system continually tests alternative configurations of layouts, networks, and color as it looks for the highest performing ones. It takes about 10,000 impressions to train the system. As users become unresponsive to the ads, the system switches to a more profitable combination of layout and networks. Setup is easy and similar to Google AdSense. In addition to supporting some of the most popular ad network options, YieldBuild offers its publishers two ad source options - the Premium Display and Premium Text Ad Programs - with which to maximize page revenue. Drawing from choice network and agency network sources, like Microsoft pubCenter, Advertising.com and Traffic Marketplace, the Premium Ad Programs grant medium-sized publishers access to ads typically restricted to much larger publishers only.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/yieldbuild.com,,http://twitter.com/yieldbuild,

Our goal with this first version is to offer content providers that are growing an audience via video on social media to take their audience off social media and into a direct relationship where the viewer can subscribe directly right in the living room to the publisher and the publisher can charge $ for access and for goods sold during broadcasts. Also the added benefit of not having to compete for viewer attention and retention by having your own private app and channel. Product 1: Osirus The product, marketed as Osirus (http://osirus.online) has turn-key content management and development tools for creating and managing private-label television channels in HD and 3D. (bespoke version where we compile and customize original channels for clients under a partnership) Platform Features: Linear TV Server for television broadcasting from pre-recorded videos Multi-platform compatible fully branded TV channel player 3D Television Mode for Virtual Reality Headsets On Screen Shopping links for real-time shopping channels with on-the-air buy-it-now monetization Product 2: VRMAKER3D The other version of the platform is called VRMAKER3D VRMAKER3D is an out of the box developer kit that enables novice developers to compile and deploy single and multi-channel television channels that are compatible with Google Cardboard and popular VR headsets like Oculus Rift and Mattel’s VR ViewMaster.  Apps compiled using VRMAKER3D are able to be deployed direct to consumers and popular app stores for android and apple iOS compatible devices including but not limited to Smart Televisions, Smartphones, In-Vehicle Infotainment, Gaming Devices and Set-Top-Boxes.

VigLink offers publishers three products: [VigLink Convert](http://www.viglink.com/products/convert) converts _existing_ links into links that earn revenue. Clicks that turn into purchases from anyone in their growing list of over 30,000 retailers, turn into commissions.

Where users can Create,Reward and Join video kindness challenges. It’s like TikTok for kindness.  Creators of Good Content are rewarded for their efforts. AWESOME has created a NEW way for you to show gratitude and instantly be rewarded by your following by receiving kindness koins. Think about if every “like” you ever received was worth 5c. AWESOME created just another way for your friends and fans to show gratitude and love for the content you are creating. Many fans don’t comment or join a video kindness challenge but they would like to show more encouragement and love than the like button provides. Here’s where they can be involved and truly reward you. Some examples of the Kindness Challenges are: Be a parking meter fairy- putting coins in expired parking meters in hopes to help someone you never meet possibly not get a ticket. OR Cupcakes for kindness- make cupcakes and show how you do it and deliver it to a neighbor or someone you just met for the first time.OR Blessings in a bag- create a bag of goodies for our less fortunate friends who are homeless. A tooth brush, tooth paste, water, vitamin-C, cookies or crackers, deodorant, and a note of encouragement and love. Kindness Koins- is a virtual digital currency that users receiving can redeem for gift cards to Groceries and Shopping around the world. Stores like like Amazon, Apple, PlayStation, Starbucks, Target Plus all your favorite restaurants or delivery apps or gift cards to support the dozens of charities listed.(20KK=1$US) To “get more” Kindness Koins for free users can watch rewarded ads or users can purchase as many as they wish in bundles.  As you participate in AWESOME you earn points and level up with your halo growing brighter and changing colors. Exchange points for animated upgrades in the virtual store. Try Inviting friends and followers to join you in a kindness challenge making the world more Awesome, then award them kindness koins. Invite followers to follow from other platforms by gifting kindness koins. There are unlimited opportunities to reward and award the use of the kindness koins. Imagine microfunding charities in fundraising kindness challenges or funding teachers classrooms by celebrating teachers' challenges they share for their class. Churches can help the underprivileged microfunding for materials and food for families in need. Creating AWESOME came After my wife Jill died 3 years ago in a texting-while-driving accident, I was left to navigate raising our 4 children under 10. Making sure my children grow into beautiful kind hearted adults is my greatest goal. These guys are growing up in a digital Social World and I want to help to do everything I can to provide them with the best tools possible, but there are no fun digital tools to create and celebrate kindness. We have seen the strength and empowerment that comes when one person does just one act of kindness, the ripple effect it creates. But how to provide a venue or tool to make it easy to create that ripple effect?   I have owned and operated multiple motels on the Beaches in Florida, a restaurant bar, created a clothing manufacturing company, started 2 different TV shows and a radio show. Plus a multi million dollar Realestate brokerage selling large estates.

One might wonder why we don’t see more streaming of live events on a paid basis. The reason is because these content providers cannot prevent people from sharing credentials or hijacking and rebroadcasting the streams. This drives the content provider’s bandwidth costs through the roof and turns an otherwise profitable show into a financial disaster. StreamGuard’s technology prevents credential sharing, stream hacking and middle-man attacks. Our tech guarantees an artist or producer that each “view” is paid for and that they are only billed for bandwidth that is generated from those paying customers.

SOCIOPAL introduces a social marketing application that allows small business owners to decrease time spent on social networking and blogging to minutes per week. SOCIOPAL algorithm prioritizes marketing activities. New York (PRWEB) June 05, 2013 SOCIOPAL (http://www.sociopal.com) has introduced a social marketing application that enables small businesses to manage multiple social media sites in just minutes per week. Social media is vital for small businesses to grow, but with so many different social networks, keeping up with the various accounts can be overwhelming and time-consuming. It can also be a daunting task to develop a successful strategy on what to post and how to get more followers. “Small businesses need corporate-level expertise in their marketing endeavors, but rarely have the resources to get it,” said Tamar Shor, CEO of SOCIOPAL. In its easy-to-use, free application, SOCIOPAL has incorporated a prioritization algorithm that guides small business owners on what, when and where they should be publishing and posting to social networks to be successful; while simultaneously monitoring online activity to determine and enhance their future marketing efforts. “The aim of this algorithm,” explained Shor, “is to optimize social marketing through ensuring quality and diverse posting and balancing both where and when posts appear. At the end of the day, small business owners want to focus on their business, not social networking, and SOCIOPAL helps them keep up with what the enterprise level players are doing online without sacrificing everything else.” SOCIOPAL allows small businesses access to advanced marketing tools such as pre-sourced content and scheduling features, which aid small business owners in calendaring professional posts to their Facebook Page, Twitter account and Blog. Nicholas Singer, owner of FITology in Washington D.C. is using SOCIOPAL to manage his online marketing, “I understood the importance of Internet marketing but was overwhelmed with the upkeep of multiple sites. SOCIOPAL helped me to improve my Internet presence while only devoting minutes per week to the project.” SOCIOPAL integrates Facebook, Twitter, and a personal Website & Blog into one seamless application that proposes content and marketing strategies for small businesses. The new application, according to Shor, promises greater efficiency and personalization while minimizing the time small business owners spend working on marketing. About SOCIOPAL SOCIOPAL was founded on the belief that while every small business needs to market via Facebook, Twitter and a personalized Website & Blog, no small business can afford to hire a social marketing expert to do it. Enter SOCIOPAL, a simple, free solution that guides you through the process and keeps your sites fresh in minutes per week. Visit http://www.sociopal.com to find out more.

This solution is called CEDR, which is an acronym describing the life-cycle of IP-managed video (Capture, Encode, Distribute, and Report). CEDR leverages what we call ""cluster-in-cloud computing"" in order to radically transform this life-cycle from a cost-intensive, geographically specific, and hardware-dependent process to a cost efficient, decentralized, and software based process that resides in the ""cloud."" CEDR has been developed by SIVOO and is proprietary to the Company. CEDR creates digital video assets from any format or source including Satellite, Internet stream, hard media, or digital file; encodes captured video into any and/or multiple specifications like CableLabs, Flash, Windows Media, Quicktime, H.264, MPEG2, etc.; distributes these assets to any IP video or broadcast distribution outlet; and tracks the views and monetization of assets in a single report. With CEDR, video assets are easily and automatically managed and distributed by and between MSOs, content aggregators, and distribution outlets. CEDR allows customers to pull video assets between locations as either a file or as a stream-link on the Internet Edge. CEDR can also push video assets to Internet sites like YouTube and MetaCafe, mobile platforms like Verizon V-Cast, IPTV providers like Verizon FIOS TV and Verismo, and cable companies like Comcast. CEDR distribution outlets include AOL, Brightcove, Charter Communications, eyespot, Grouper, Guba, HotWire, iFilm, iTunes Podcasts, Joost, jumpcut, JumpTV, MediaMelon, MetaCafe, MobiTV, MySpace, SES Americom, Terra, Verismo, Verizon FIOS TV, Verizon V-Cast, Videoegg, Vimeo, VOY, VSocial, and YouTube.

This allows the users to keep some posts completely private or share some posts with the world.  Either way the post will be saved on a great looking site. Finally, in order to post frequently and easily, Rollr came out with a very simple mobile application.  The application is available for both Android and iPhone, and it ensures that the users are able to update their websites easily.   Right now, development is done in San Pedro Sula, Honduras as the co-founder/developer lives there.

Our purpose, our mission, our passion Foster an environment which values photography. Empower photographers to succeed. Encourage photographers' passion to create. PicturEngine brings image buyers and sellers together with just a click.  Serving as a resource and guide to the entire stock industry, we make every stock photo, Illustration, vector and footage searchable through one easy-to-use platform. Just like other search engines, PicturEngine is FREE to use.  The ability to quickly and easily search the whole stock photo industry at once saves time and ensures the best results. Larger stock photo agencies are included within the organic results.  Photographers and smaller photo agencies, pay a small ‘advertising’ subscription fee to be included within the search results.  It’s important to note that search results are UNBIASED, meaning advertisers cannot pay to gain higher ranking within the search.             As stock photo agencies have grown to mammoth proportions, finding the ""right"" image is more difficult and time-consuming than ever.  Searching through countless images within multiple agency archives has become commonplace, and image buyers say they need to find images faster.  Because only a few agencies practice ""image exclusivity,"" the same content appears over and over again, further complicating the search for stock photos.  PicturEngine search results quickly provide image buyers with industrywide results without duplication.  We show buyers the base agency, removing unnecessary intermediaries, and encourage exploration of content by providing a closer look at ""similars,"" enabling the buyer to make an informed purchasing decision. PicturEngine makes finding the right image fast and easy.",,,https://www.twitter.com/picturengine,https://www.facebook.com/picturengine
