Feldman, the creator of the PC/104 IEEE standard.","ZF Micro Solutions is a privately held company founded in 2002 by David L. Feldman, the creator of the PC/104 IEEE standard and the 5-1/4"" form factor embedded Single Board Computer. In March of 2002 National Semiconductor Corporation advised Mr. Feldman that it would not manufacture the ZFx86™ for ZF Micro Solutions. ZF Micro Solutions filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, State of California, as ZF Micro Solutions, Inc. vs. National Semiconductor Corporation. It was filed on April 25, 2002 under case # CV807339. Effective January 31, 2005, ZF Micro Solutions finalized a settlement agreement with National Semiconductor Corporation ending an almost 3 year legal dispute concerning the ZFx86™ FailSafe® System-on-a-Chip. On January 31, 2005 National Semiconductor delivered all ZFx86™ property to ZF Micro Solutions. This allowed ZF to establish a new manufacturing source for the ZFx86™ and a family of additional products. Our current manufacturing partner is IBM Microelectronics In 1995, Mr. Feldman founded ZF Micro Devices, and began manufacturing and marketing a family of products based on an award-winning computer module called the OEMmodule Single Component Computer. These devices were the most highly integrated, PC-compatible controller modules in the embedded systems market. They included full motherboard hardware and software functionally in a single, highly reliable component smaller than a credit card.  Mr. Feldman then took this small form factor to the next level and combined full x86 PC functionality together with its patented fail-safe technology, into a single chip, the ZFx86™ “PC-on-a-Chip.” This device, just 1.4” square, represents the next level of integration of PC functionality. ZFx86™ is the only chip with a built-in FailSafe® mechanism for restoring operation after a system failure. The Intel x86 compatible ZFx86™ chip runs most PC software without modification and is bundled with a full PC BIOS and Linux O/S - and it boots by simply applying power! Today, our full time efforts are focused on rebuilding the company and expanding our product offering.",,,,

Consumer Problem - Shopping local retailers online is mostly non-existent and a poor experience at best. Solution: XION makes it insanely easy for small retailers to create an ecommerce store. Small retailers simply create a store on our marketplace website and add products from our database.  A consumer uses our site to shop their local retailers online and in one place. With our site they can see which local retailers carry the products they are looking for and can purchase them directly on our site or just go to the nearest shop and get it. Mission Statement: XION’s mission is to create the best consumer shopping experience. Why We’re Doing This: Dan Fairbanks started XION because when he was operating his own specialty running stores and e-commerce site he got really fed up with the bad software he was using. Dan couldn't find a software solution that truly made my life easier as a small retailer. He knew there had to be a better way. Dan teamed up with Robert Ivie, a veteran software engineer, and together they are building the future of omni-channel retailing. Team: Dan Fairbanks - CEO - Dan graduated from BYU with a degree in entrepreneurship in 2009. Dan started and operated his own running stores and e-commerce website for 4 years in the Seattle area. He then went to a coding bootcamp to learn iOS development, which he did professionally for 2 years before starting XION. Dan was in the first Startup Ignition cohort where he applied the lean startup methodology to validate his ideas with customers. Dan has a knack for great UI/UX design and will hustle to do whatever needs to be done to make XION a success. Robert Ivie - CTO - Robert is a veteran programmer who can get a lot done quickly. He excels solving complex problems and works really well in teams. Robert has worked for big companies and startups alike including Ancestry, ProPay, Powercode, and FamilySearch. Robert has turned down CTO offers at other companies to work on XION because he believes in XION’s mission.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/7617426/,,https://twitter.com/XIONretail,https://www.facebook.com/shopxion

Solution: WhoYou allows users to have complete control over their social media experience because, for the user, YOU are the master of the content that you see, hear, and feel. You are able to pull out the information from other users that you’re interested in, freeing you from the incessant negativity that is now available. For businesses, user’s cynical insinuations caused by your advertising will disappear, as you will be able to communicate in a real, unobtrusive human manner with those people most interested in the products and services that you provide, in a completely preemptive manner. This is a completely new way to connect and it’s not just exciting because it’s different, it’s exciting because it’s better. WhoYou Mission Statement: We are a tool for connecting like-minded users, creating human understanding from a technology application. We seek to eliminate unwanted peer-to-peer interactions by enabling positivity and good-natured conversations for all users and aim to divest humanity from the cynicism and hate that is pervasive on social media. All social media today is push-oriented meaning users push their opinions, politics, humor and more onto each other. WhoYou is the first ever pull-oriented connection application. Users pull the information out from one another that they are interested in, enabling positive, value-added interactions. WhoYou is the ultimate combination between a search engine and a social media platform. No other company provides this same service! How it Works: A user sets their geographic area and searches for a word or phrase. They can also add connotation to their search to give it specificity. If another user in their area is searching for the same word or phrase, their profile will appear (a little bio, pictures, other searches). The original user can take a look and then send them a message. The receiver can preview the message before they accept it. If they do accept the message, a conversation can begin.  Here’s a quick example; you set your area for 10 miles and search for “Angel Investor”. You can add specificity to your search by adding “Let’s talk about…” Anyone else searching for “Angel Investor” within 10 miles will appear. You can then look at their profile and if you like what you see, you can send them a message. If they accept, you can start chatting!",https://www.linkedin.com/company/whoyouapp/,,https://twitter.com/WhoYouApp,https://www.facebook.com/whoyouapp

The Weed Zinger is the only weeding tool that shoots the weed directly into a trash can without the need to bend over to pick-up the extracted weeds.  Simply step...twist & zing the weed away.  There currently are several stand-up weeding tools on the market, most of them are effective at removing the weed.  There are two models that we would consider our closest competition but they both require a physical force to eject the weed.  Neither product is capable of ejecting the weed directly into the waste container without applying sufficient force.

Removing the weed from the ground is only half the job. At some point it is necessary to pick up the weed and place it in a waste container.  The Weed Zinger propels the weed 3-6’ statically, 10-15’ is possible with a swinging motion. At a local event, we pitched the idea to Kevin O'Leary from ABC's Shark Tank.

Those are the cocktails for success.  That was very impressive.” We have manufacturing, sales and distribution in place.  What we need right now is funding.

Visible Path,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/visiblepath,http://VisiblePath.com,"Computer, Social Media, Software","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",Visible Path is a business social network allowing users to organize and display their business contacts.,"Nipping at the heels of competitor [LinkedIn](http://crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin), Visible Path is a new incarnation of business social networking.  Visible Path entered the market with a different way of organizing and displaying your business contacts.  Instead of showing all of your extended contacts to all the contacts in your network like LinkedIn, Visible Path focuses more on strength of relationship between contacts to determine who can add who to their contact list.  This effort precludes ""contact farmers"" from adding you simply for the sake of adding someone.  In a smaller circle of contacts, your relationships are more meaningful and cannot be as easily diluted.  In order to create this more discriminatory contact circle Visible Path collects information about all your contacts through a 6mb Microsoft Outlook plugin which tracks who you've sent emails to or have meetings with.   The more often you are in contact with someone through Outlook, the stronger the relationship and vice versa.  People outside of Outlook can also be added to Visible Path, but must be done so by searching for them specifically.  Since contacts are generally all made through Outlook, the business relationships you make are very real.  Because Visible Path users do not have the option of seeing your extended network, a much higher percentage of your business contacts will actually be people you have conversed with. At its current state, Visible Path's Outlook plugin is prone to simply making all your office contacts your strongest.  User's may email or have meetings with people in their office more consistently than they do with very important contacts who work for other companies or in different locations.  In these cases Visible Path would incorrectly recognize the importance of your relationships.  It's a fallacy that more contact with someone means you have a stronger relationship with them.  Visible Path is currently looking into other methods to track relationship strength.  Drawing data from phone calls and IM's is currently on their plate, but some way for the content of conversations needs to be analyzed for Visible Path to work without flaw.  Business Networks are very helpful when all your contacts are meaningful.  Unfortunately exposure to the web often causes networks to expand rather than become more useful.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/visible-path,,https://www.twitter.com/hoovers,https://www.facebook.com/hoovers-96955415262

Compared to for-profit businesses, nonprofits face significant double standards when it comes to overhead expenditure. Most donors have a visceral aversion to overheads, wanting a majority of their donation to go directly to the cause and not towards compensation, advertising & marketing spend, investment in IT and innovation etc. Sadly, this 'Overhead Myth' is crippling the nonprofit sector, stagnating innovation and destroying growth potential. ​It seems counterintuitive that the very organizations that have altruistically committed themselves to making the world a better place, are often constrained from maximally doing so! ​We empower nonprofits to break free from the ""The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle"" by providing services that help them not just to survive, but to grow! Rather than handouts, we provide leg-ups in areas that they need it most.  Here's how it works: 1) Consumers purchase products from our ecommerce partners 2) A set percentage from each sale is paid by these businesses to Virtueconomy 3) ​We then convert those funds into valuable services for the matched nonprofit partner As a male founder, it was important to me to become an ally and stand up for the gender inequality that continues to persist in the business world.  As such, Virtueconomy's initial focus is on Women Empowerment -- We create shared value by matching female founded enterprises with relevant nonprofits that empower, educate and uplift women.",,,https://www.twitter.com/virtueconomy,https://www.facebook.com/virtueconomy

Virtual Computer,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/virtual-computer,http://www.virtualcomputer.com,"Hardware, Virtual Desktop, Virtualization","Hardware, Information Technology, Software",Virtual Computer provides intelligent desktop virtualization solutions.,"Virtual Computer is a venture-backed software company in the Boston area that develops intelligent desktop virtualization solutions.  It's flagship product, NxTop, combines centralized management with local execution on an enhanced Xen-based type-1 hypervisor that runs directly on end-user devices, delivering native performance and mobility. By running the workload on the PC, Virtual Computer enables companies to have centralized management without servers, storage, and networking required for server-hosted VDI. The technology supports shared image management, enabling an IT professional to manage thousands of desktops and laptops the same way that they would manage one. In March 2011, Virtual Computer announced its collaboration with Lenovo to optimize Virtual Computer's NxTop client virtualization and management solution on Lenovo's business-oriented systems. These include select models of Lenovo's ThinkCentre A and M series desktops and ThinkPad T and X series laptops. Centralized Virtual Desktop Management One-to-many Provisioning. NxTop   provides  a central console for all desktop management activities. IT teams create and maintain a single virtual machine per operating system that can be published  to  thousands  of users. User-specific  personality, data, settings and applications are applied dynamically at each endpoint. Scalable Patching with Rollback. Patches and  updates are applied on a one-to-many basis. The IT administrator applies patches once to a master virtual machine. Upon republishing, the changed data is streamed to NxTop PCs running the virtual machine. A patched image is assembled in  the background and  transparently loaded on the next reboot.  IT can also easily rollback a patch. Integrated Security AES-256 Disk Encryption. All virtual machine and system data on NxTop- enabled PCs can be encrypted, providing peace of a mind in the event that a PC containing sensitive data is lost or stolen. Policy Controls. IT administrators can protect against data leakage and  unauthorized  use through a  robust set of policy controls.  Access to hardware such as  USB ports and network interfaces can be restricted  or filtered  based on centrally  defined policies at global, group, and individual-user  levels. Virtual machines can be  governed by time-based  expiration  policies and  on-demand remote disablement. Remote Termination  with  Data Destruction. As an added layer of security, IT administrators can flag lost PCs for remote termination. If  a  lost  or  stolen  PC  connects  to  a  network, it  is directed  to digitally  shred all data and  encryption keys, then self- destruct. Hassle-Free Data Backup and Restore Transparent Data Protection. Based on   centrally  defined policies, NxTop periodically initiates  data backup with no  end-user interaction required. Efficient Data Transmission. NxTop   backup  technology captures changes at the block level, transmitting only the blocks that have changed to NxTop Center. Advanced  Management for Distributed Organizations Intelligent Remote Office Caching. Downstream management servers may be deployed at remote offices to intelligently cache and distribute updates for more efficient bandwidth utilization. Local Backup Storage.  User data backups may be  localized at remote offices, speeding system recovery and  avoiding unnecessary strain on wide area network links. Remote Helpdesk. Simply  enable remote  support  from  the  NxTop  Center  console  for  immediate remote PC control even in the event of a catastrophic operating system failure such as a Windows blue screen of death.",,,http://twitter.com/virtualcomputer,https://www.facebook.com/virtualcomputer/

Viotalk app is available for ios and android platforms. Communication is a dynamic process with the interacting components of sending, receiving messages. Generally communication can be done through verbal and non verbal. Non-verbal communication regulates relationships between messages and meaning, and may support or replace verbal communication. It is impossible to complete human communication without non-verbal one. Body language penetrates the personal secrets of strangers, friends and lovers by interpreting their body movements and how to make use of body language powers but now a day’s most of digital communication such as the testing with phone, email using Internet using computers just uses typing WORDS. However, a human communication is composed of not only words, but also sensitivity-like non-verbal one. Non-verbal information like the human voice, gesture, and emotion rather than verbal one is more useful to understand the user's inclination exactly. However it is quite difficult to catch the meaning of non-verbal information without looking at recording video of the person non-verbal behaviour. One of main feature of Viotalk is recording cloud video so it doesn’t use your internal storage or external storage all the recordings on the server which are highly secured.
