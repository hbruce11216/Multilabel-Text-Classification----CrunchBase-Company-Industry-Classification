All participants in the Content Marketplace: Content Providers, Advertisers and Consumers have pains in the current system. Content Providers want to create enhanced engagement, know more about their viewers, deliver enhanced advertising and create simple, better Search Engine Optimization within their sites as well as in traditional Search Engines. Advertisers know there is an audience but they want to know the Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Products they are associated with fit all their marketing needs and do not create tensions. Consumers want a simple and easy experience that will also allow them to have a voice. Currently, there is too much unidentifiable or inappropriately labeled Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Product content on too many channels to properly make it all fit. Where and what is all this Big Data? 451 Degrees has created Graffiti, a Big Data software as a service (SaaS), that, without requiring any change to the original content, helps solve these issues and more. Graffiti follows content, whether it is an article, video, image, music or product, over multiple locations such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook plus others and analyzes all comments and info about that piece as an independent source and in symphony. Graffiti works with content publishers; news sites, video sites, image sites, product sites, blogs, e-commerce product sites and any one with comments or a desire to increase consumer engagement within their site. Big Data bringing Real Time results increasing revenues and relevance. Here’s how it works... Utilizing a simple bi-directional API, Graffiti analyzes large data sets so they can be used in a pro-active and revenue generating capacity to identify opportunities and strategies to better engage your consumer, deliver better advertising or product placement to your product and define all things properly. Graffiti is built to specifically analyze and redefine Internet content in REAL TIME by augmenting existing meta data with user generated comments. In short - Graffiti recognizes what is actually being said and its relevance by using patented Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) techniques. Most Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files or e-Commerce Products contain some original meta data placed on that content by the owners of that content. As a web based analytics tool and service, Graffiti will continually analyze these articles of content and update them with more relevant, truly organic, “meta tags” based on actual comments and what is really being talked about. These updates are automated in Real Time as new meta data. The content continues to evolve as the community Comments about it. This translates into the consumers ability to easily find the Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files and Products they seek. User commentary is better defined and assists the content owner with developing a true, instead of perceived or desired, set of tags originally placed by the content owner. What are the benefits to our Clients? Our core functionality allows our clients to analyze Big Data in Real Time, classify and redefine content by evaluating user comment based data generated through consumer engagement. This is no longer “junk” but the most useful element of any content. It is the audience of many brought into focus and use. The evaluation of Big Data, in the form of comments, in turn generates more true engagement which delivers stronger and more refined meta data to use when optimizing search (SEO) as well as Ad Delivery Networks (ADN) Key Word targets or Product Placement for every piece of content. Graffiti accomplishes this by collecting ALL comments available across the web and applying a proprietary algorithm to determine the most appropriate meta-tags and serving these refined meta-tags as a service in REAL TIME back to the original source. As well as to the Ad Delivery Network or Recommendation  Engine for increased transaction opportunity in Real Time. This Ad Delivery Network can exist as a stand alone Below The Fold (BTF) ADN thus creating and entire new frontier of revenue inside a barren wasteland. These are found revenues that are proven to be of the highest values in Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA) transactions. Who Can Use Graffiti? Graffiti works with businesses that wants to make deep learning sense of comments and other consumer commentary and use it for engagement and revenue generation practices. Our target clients are Content Owners, Media, Consumer Brands, BioTech, e-Commerce and multi-national Corporations as well as strategic partners with existing technology solutions where we can provide added value to their offering.

Neurons and Synapses are represented by Polymorphic Object Oriented Multidimensional Map Space and Connection Vectors respectively. This Neural Network includes a Cortex for each type of abstract data becoming an Unsupervised Learning Convolutional Network. This constantly growing group of datasets become A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s knowledgebase and every time a specific synapse is accessed it glows on a 3D working model representing the process of active thinking by exciting the neurons of a certain synapse in multiple abstaction layers autonomously. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. appears to be conscious when inputs of any kind are compared against it's neural network, matching and identifying with Fuzzy Logic algorithms and self-learning new patterns as unknown datasets are presented and analyzed by each one of the Cortexes. This identification of patterns along with specific rules, pre-set objectives, directives, accuracy and restriction parameters are used to identify any desired optimum working area. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. then presents recommendations, predictions, corrective actions and feedback as a closed loop control system but talking human language, thus, effectively showing the behavior of Artificial Intelligence. The polymorphic nature of A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s Object Oriented Inheritance layers under unsupervised learning enable the processing of any pattern of any size and any dimension. Storing references, concepts, types, properties, values, 3D datasets, stereo images, audio, statistics, characteristics and classes all with inheritance properties in a polymorphic multidimensional abstract layers allows A.I.L.E.E.N.N. to receive, store, compare and identify datasets of any kind against it's current knowledge in memory and compare it to overtime and realtime behavior samples. This means that any given input like images, letters, numbers, words, paragraphs, sounds, video, contexts, trends and any dataset is learned, analyzed, identified and can be identified,  predicted and controlled by A.I.L.E.E.N.N.  The way this is achieved is by unleashing the processing power of multiple CPU and GPU cloud based clusters using multithreaded parallel processing on the code implementation and providing virtually infinite memory space for A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s Brain to function over Cloud Based distributed processes and storage. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. is the next step for technology evolution, it's created as a result of applying many years of multidisciplinary expertise and the latest technology all this while thinking outside ANY box.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/a-i-l-e-e-n-n-/,,,https://www.facebook.com/AILEENeuralNetwork/

Seeing a convergence of AI tools, biosensors, and compute power becoming available at a global scale and sharing a vision for what a “fully-connected human” could mean, the two decided to team-up and start developing for a wider audience. The idea quickly became to build the best real-time brain decoding platform possible – an enabling piece of technology that could be plugged into the broader ecosystem to make things responsive to streaming emotion, attention and other brain-related measures. If such a platform were done right, Eitan and Dan reckoned, a whole new class of entertainment, health, training, and other applications could emerge that would be individual brain-centric and dynamic in ways that would create radical new abilities. With first proof-of-concept, Arctop raised seed funding from venture and angel investors and in 2017 opened its R&D center in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Our software prescribes actions that produce better answers, faster.","Artificial Intelligence, by itself, is not necessarily actionable. While predictions are insightful and useful, they often leave it up to humans to make decisions to take advantage of the foresight. Enter Ayata – our software combines Artificial Intelligence (the science of predictions) with Operations Research (the science of decision making). Ayata’s software predicts what’s ahead and prescribes how to take advantage of this predicted future, without disrupting other priorities. For critical processes at large corporations, Ayata's software ingests videos, images, sounds, text, and numbers - together - to continually predict performance metrics and prescribe how to improve this predicted performance.  Since more than 80% of the world's data is unstructured, any technology focused on improving future performance must be capable of taking into account ALL data - not just numbers and/or text - to generate accurate predictions and actionable prescriptions. Ayata’s software can and does.  In Oil & Gas, Ayata's software has modeled more than 14,000 horizontal shale wells from 6 leading operators in 4 major North American shale plays. Results include 9.8% increase in first year production, 100-day decrease in new well breakeven, and 24% increase in per well ROR. In Insurance, Ayata's software is predicting losses for auto and home insurance policies for all US customers of a ""Fortune 50"" Insurance company, and running their claims litigation process end-to-end. In High-Tech, Ayata's software helped Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell, and Juniper Networks improve Customer Service, Field Service, Retail Operations, and Parts Logistics.  Ayata already has 35 US Patents – 9 Issued – and 2 US Trademarks. Ayata’s inventions combine disparate scientific disciplines – such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Metaheuristics, and Operations Research – to predict what’s ahead and prescribe how to benefit from this future. Our technology architecture is inspired by the Central Nervous System (“CNS”) in the human body. The CNS orchestrates and controls most of the body’s activities even though such processes are rarely conscious. Ayata’s software does the same for complex, mission critical operations. Ayata’s Board of Advisors include prominent senior executives from Google, Chevron, BP, Deloitte, McKinsey, Barclays, and BHP Billiton. Ayata has been featured on Bloomberg TV (twice), HART Energy Conferences (four times), Deloitte Oil & Gas Conference, Deloitte PPMD Conference, Energy Makers Show, Oil & Gas Investor, E&P Magazine, WIRED, GigaOm, InformationWeek, Gizmodo, and other prominent media venues.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/ayata,,https://twitter.com/ayataanalytics,https://www.facebook.com/AyataAnalytiics/

BEAD analysis learns from the building and its users and is empowered to start taking over the most intelligent operation of the building. The building will not only be a smart building but also a building operated by artificial intelligence based on ever-improving, anonymised data. It controls automation and redirects energy to be used where and when it is needed. Its logic builds on the idea that buildings are dynamic entities and should be treated more like living and learning organisms and not like static dumb assets. Today, they give the opportunity to commercial buildings owners who don't know how they consume energy to connect with the buildings life cycle in order to save energy and cost while getting the same level of quality as up to now via operating the buildings with BEADs' AI. With the help of BEAD the buildings will have a smart energy agent that works and operates the building 7/24. BEAD furthermore analyses how commercial buildings consume energy according to human behavior, occupancy ratios and ambiance and environmental changes in the building in order to give real-time feedback to the automation system.

Today's generation of consumers is the most disloyal in history. Why? Because they won't stay loyal just based off products, unlike their parents before them. They insist on buying from socially responsible brands that stand for the causes they support. We're solving for this through the Because SaaS Belief Marketing Platform. Because helps the 80% of U.S. consumer businesses who give back to charity, to build long-term brand differentiation with their consumers through belief-based social media engagement, rather than product advertising.    How it works: Because uses proprietary machine learning algorithms to produce a daily curation of the highest quality ""matches""​ for Marketing teams to organically engage their ideal influencers, who are live on social talking about the same social causes their brand supports. Then they can share their story out with their network, and give you an opportunity to expose your brand to potential customers through common beliefs.

Because helps Marketing teams reduce customer acquisition costs by moving away from paid influencer engagements and product-driven advertising, to organic Because engagements with micro-influencers who just so happen to already love the causes you love.

More than 10 million people in the US suffer from memory loss, which can be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and dementia), brain injuries, stroke, heart attack, or the simple aging process.  BlipIQ's intuitive interface allows users to submit and tag memories in different formats (text, image, audio, and video). The application monitors and stimulates the patient's cognitive performance, which is reported to family, physicians, and insurers in order to improve quality of life, outcomes, and to reduce costs for all parties involved. As of 2017, 11% Americans over 65 have Alzheimer's, and this number is expected to increase every year due to the aging population. This degenerative condition often results in emotional and financial strain for the patient and their beloved ones, with devastating out-of-pocket costs of up to $56 billion for families and over $200 billion to insurers per year. The average cost of a long-term care facility is approximately $48,000 per year. Since a patient needing memory care can live up to 8 years in a facility, the potential expenses over that period may reach $384,000. In addition, today's Alzheimer medications vary in cost up to $4,800 per year.  BlipIQ's ultimate goal is threefold: To improve the quality of life for memory loss patients and their families by interacting and connecting them through the app, to improve the doctor's insights with enhanced reporting on patients, and to reduce the overwhelming costs for the families and insurers.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/blipiq,,https://twitter.com/blipiq,https://business.facebook.com/pg/BlipIQ/posts/

Butlr’s proprietary hardware pairs with advanced AI to gain insight into people’s movements in physical space, providing actionable intelligence to assisted living, homes, and public spaces, all while safeguarding privacy.  Butlr is a spin-off from the MIT Media Lab. Butlr’s sensor network captures human dynamics through state-of-art sensory monitoring and AI, understanding users’ needs to achieve a seamless automation experience, preventing risk, and monitoring health.  Responsive architecture is a vision of a future where the built environment is as customizable as a streaming music podcast, based on simple, intelligent architectural objects. The natural world is in a constant state of flux; combinations of moisture, breeze and temperature change continuously. When we are inside our buildings, however, our environment loses its dynamism, and we’re forced to constantly tweak the conditions to achieve optimal comfort. Responsive architecture uses intelligent objects to mirror the processes of the natural world, creating environments and “microclimates” that are suited to individuals or small groups based on the heat signature of their bodies.  Today the team at Butlr uses small, low-cost sensors to track the motions and body heat of Each person has a biometric heat signature as unique as a fingerprint. The Butlr sensors recognize an individual’s heat signature, and can modify room temperature and lighting for ideal comfort. Unlike cameras that track and record faces, the Butlr system relies on a heat signature, which is unique, but cannot be used to trace your identity.  Starting from home applications, the future vision for responsive architecture is to empower cities with networks of heat sensors that can make cities responsive, predicting and responding to vehicle flows, pedestrian density, and weather conditions on the fly. Using thermal data provides many news layers of interaction not possible with cameras.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/livebutlr,,https://twitter.com/livebutlr,https://www.facebook.com/livebutlr

This should be a time every teenager looks forward to without any worry of violence or crime because they are being attentively protected for the case of extreme danger. Right now, that isn’t entirely true.” - Sean Levinson, Elite Daily, April 11, 2013 Never-Before-Offered, In-The-Moment, Mobile Conflict Resolution & Mediation Caroami is an online conflict resolution and mediation platform operated through a messaging interface. It uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and Machine Learning to resolve conflicts in-the-moment, before they escalate, such as roommate disputes, dating issues, ghosted friendships, unfriended pals, gender politics, and sexual harassment. The millennial market looks for an instant, mobile, and electronic solution to conflict.  $2.9B Market Opportunity Higher education institutions are in turmoil, and Caroami is ready to step in to help at this pivotal time with our unique offering. The college experience has always been demanding, and students face a range of interpersonal problems that determine their success or failure. Add to that the effect mobile and social technology has had on the social skills of students entering college in recent years leaving them without adequate negotiating or communication skills to resolve disputes. Even though 98% of the 83.1M Millenials in the US use a smartphone, there is no digital tool on the market that provides an instant, mobile, or confidential way to help them resolve interpersonal conflict. Traditional, off-line mediation solutions are time-intensive, cumbersome, and extremely costly. In addition to higher education, Caroami is poised to serve corporate users, HOAs, courts, government, and the military with a market potential of $2.9B and growing. The future of conflict resolution is digital, instantaneous, and mobile, and is currently not being adequately served. Workplace discrimination against employees based on race, gender, or sexual orientation costs businesses an estimated $64 billion annually, not including the cost to their reputation or workplace morale. When companies buy harassment insurance, they are not protecting the victims. Caroami protects both the end user and the organization. Value Proposition From frazzled to happy, students can now use Caroami to resolve their roommate disputes, gender politics, sexual harassment, and other issues at the moment with our messaging interface-based mobile which replaces the slow, inadequate, and rather public Facebook and Twitter apps they are currently using for this purpose. Colleges, universities, and other organizations can avoid costly settlements, expensive lawyers, and hits to their reputations with the help of our app that affordably uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and ML to guide students to de-escalate potential violence and restore relationships that have gone awry. It also has applications in cases of gender, religion, and identity politics that pose legal, PR nightmares, and attrition, all while keeping problems internal to the organization.  Happy students turn into happy alumni and future donors. Paying clients will receive data/analytics to better plan next academic year. Employers can identify and prevent problems way before they escalate. Students will learn to resolve conflicts over time, promote wellness, and preserve friendships.

BioNimbus allows for the real time gathering and analysis of discrete data emanating from the human body in response to varied stimuli through sensors or mobile wearables. The BioNimbus technology can be applied to anything that can be sensed (e.g. sound, smell, a human interaction, etc.) and the test outcome can be appropriately designed. BioNimbus is a powerful economic disruptive force, delivering similar or better analysis to the customer faster and at costs of $300 CPI (Cost per Interview) rather than $500 to $800 CPI. Using political analysis as an example, the BioNimbus technology conducted a study in October of 2016 with faculty members of the Texas Tech the College of Media and Communications. The study investigated what genuinely causes the hard-to-move undecided voters in elections to “budge”. Budging is defined as the act of finally moving an implacable undecided definitively toward a specific candidate. The stimuli used were specific candidate inflections (eleven primary inflections). BioNimbus’ AI tools analyzed the impulse data inflections most strongly statistically correlated with “budging”. The results of the study were almost identical, in terms of voter percentage, to the national election results. The BioNimbus technology has already been applied to Consumer Packaging (“CPG”) projects. BioNimbus enables rapid testing of design concepts allowing companies to determine suitability and engagement by users and consumers at all stages of a product life cycle. It is a powerful risk management tool for a company providing insights at the stages (i.e. design, concept, prototype) when it is more economic to make product changes. A client has a great deal of control with BioNimbus with the ability to set up tests and receive analysis of data in a dashboard format. BioNimbus has applicability for a wide range of vertical markets. Aside from political analysis and CPG, other markets include education (i.e. engagement testing of content preparation), law enforcement and corrections (i.e. surveys and training of proper procedures) healthcare (i.e. labeling, protocol training) and government (i.e. armed forces training).  Technology development and initial product trials to date has been funded internally by Cascade Strategies. Cascade Strategies is moving ahead to roll out the applications of the BioNimbus technology establishing partnerships involving analytics and operations partners, market research companies (sample providers, research services) and Product Lifecycle Management companies (major established and emerging design companies).",https://www.linkedin.com/company/cascade-strategies-inc.,,https://www.twitter.com/cascadestrat,https://www.facebook.com/cascadestrategies

With CAST, developers can focus on their applications, CAST manages and optimizes their infrastructures on any cloud providers, automatically, without the need of DevOps: Day 1 Ops: CAST creates the infrastructure for Kubernetes: one cluster. many clouds. 30 minutes. Day 2 Ops: CAST manages the cluster once an application has been deployed: only use required resources and arbitrage the most efficient compute resources. Self heal: cloud micro failures are no more disasters. No DevOps: full automated management No more vendor lock-in: Unlike Kubernetes services from cloud vendors, such as EKS (AWS Kubernetes) or GKE (Google Cloud), organizations will avoid vendor lock in by deploying across any clouds. We adopted this philosophy for ourselves also: Customers can elect to stop using CAST, their applications will continue to work, forever. Cloud financial arbitrage As the Kubernetes cluster spans across multiple public clouds, the platform will optimize for cost and performance using the opportunities of price differences across clouds. The platform finds the most cost-effective public clouds and geolocations for your containers in real time. You can create simple policies that dictate the boundaries of the optimization. For example, you can set CAST AI to only create new VMs if CPU utilization is more than 90%, or destroy and consolidate VMs when the CPUs are less than 20%. A cloud failure does not mean a disaster Cloud providers experienced micro failures all the time. With CAST managed infrastructure, a cloud failure will not result in a disaster: CAST will simply note the temporary unavailability of resources and move these resources to a different location, automatically. Start with one cloud, expand and evolve to many clouds Create and manage K8s clusters with superior observability, troubleshooting and insight on a single cloud. CAST cost optimization and cost insight will engage and look for the best deployment strategies within the single cloud. At any time, at the customer's choice, CAST can gradually expand the cost optimization strategy across clouds, by expanding the horizon of cost inefficiencies of other cloud providers. No more mundane DevOps CAST removes humans from having to deal with the cloud complexity using automation. We create architectures that span cloud providers, and create a more valuable self-healing, self-optimize layer to help build and deploy business solutions. For developers and DevOps: a simplified Kubernetes, with a box of chocolate CAST installs the open source Kubernetes standard that comes with a box of chocolate: full observability solution, including logs, metrics, security. There is no specific requirements of any kind, no rewrite of the application for multi cloud, and you can bring your favorite CI/CD (continuous integration continuous deployment): deploy your Kubenetes as usual, the cluster will simply span all the clouds that you have selected. Day 1 Ops is a 30 minute task. A secure deployment CAST automated IaaS management, within guidelines and policies defined by the customer. We simplify security by eliminating misconfiguration and human intervention. Moreover, CAST deployments are made inside the cloud accounts of the customers. Hence we don't introduce change to any of the cybersecurity platforms and policies of our customers.   Full cloud interoperability: Cloud services and data storage span across clouds Clusters get full access to all of the cloud-native services of the other clouds. For example, storage or RDS services (AWS database service) are available seamlessly to all the workloads of the cluster, even if some of these workloads are actually executed on Azure VMs. Any of the usual cloud services that you may be already using will just work automagically.   So here’s how it all works: If you use containers, use CAST AI to deploy your clusters. Use CAST Dashboard or via APIs, the platform will take care of the cluster management and deployment, with standard Kubernetes. Select one or multiple clouds. If you use cloud services, they will just continue to work as usual. CAST deploys inside your cloud accounts: CAST AI is an orchestration layer that commands cloud platforms via APIs. This means that the platform creates and sets up all the cloud resources in your existing cloud accounts of AWS and/or Azure and/or Google. All these resources are yours, available in your accounts.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/cast-ai,,https://twitter.com/cast_ai,https://www.facebook.com/CASTAi-112140013763781/

Simply stated, they work with you to obtain better results from your existing data and connected enterprise assets. For many organizations, blindly collecting massive amounts of data and storing it in hyperscale databases does not lead to better outcomes. They have found that the solution is to design models and write software programs that, to the extent possible, produce the desired behavior from a small set of instructions rather than a vast table. The result is better conversion rates of data monetization, simpler operations, and faster time to solutions. There are many examples showing that this can be done successfully. For example, the huge tables of square roots used by engineers in the 1970s have now been replaced by a simple five-line program on electronic calculators. The question is, can they leverage AI to do the same to solve their most immediate business and operational problems? They know the answer is yes.

Commoot brings “awareness to the road” by utilizing unused advertising space on the trailers of semi-trucks, box trucks, and large vehicles. Graphic, eye-catching “billboard-like” ads are attached to trailers through heat-wrapped vinyl or a ‘poster’ framing system. Commoot helps brands by supporting brand awareness initiatives, as well as creating a stronger and more tactical campaign for clients. Beyond becoming a new platform for OOH media, Commoot plans to innovate in a few other ways. Commoot is one of the first platforms to allow quick and seamless OOH campaign creation through a marketplace website. Commoot is currently building proprietary technology that can track a very large amount of data through camera technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and geographical information systems, and more. Our technology can allow corporations, cities, and other organizations to make major decisions more easily through the use of our data.  How Commoot Benefits Brands Commoot benefits brands by ensuring their ad messaging reaches audiences more frequently, for longer, and in a way that does not allow the user to become “blind” to the ad message. Commoot takes your Out of Home marketing budgets further with more insight than traditional billboards can provide. Commoot benefits brands of all sizes grow their awareness and convert new customers by reaching them where other mediums of advertising simply can not. How Commoot Benefits Trucking Companies Commoot partners with trucking companies and fleet owners across the country to lease their unused white space on the sides of their shipping containers. Trucking companies and fleet owners benefit from increased revenue, which can be extremely impactful in today’s current economy. No need to worry about the ‘logistics’ of ad placement. Commoot does all the work for you, while helping you earn more revenue from your unused ad space. How Commoot Benefits Marketing Agencies Commoot allows Marketing Agencies to provide their clients with a powerful form of Out of Home (OOH) marketing and branding. Commoot provides real, actionable data to further supplement their marketing campaigns. Agencies can bring unique, exciting advertising and branding opportunities to their clients in ways that traditional Billboards cannot.  Stronger, more memorable ads = Higher ROI Learn More Why Commoot Works Commoot provides brands with longer impression exposure to customers, ads that are closer to consumers, larger ad spaces, and more data to support the advertisements. Different from Competition Refresh and reawaken the impression-based ad space by limiting competition and emphasizing ad retention. Move away from the cluttered online ad market and move towards an exciting, unique OOH campaign. Keeping Ads Fresh Most forms of advertising fall victim to “ad blindness”, which occurs when viewers have become too accustomed to seeing the same advertisements. Commoot solves this issue by working with a continuously moving medium, ensuring less ad blindness and continuous exposure to new audiences. Economic Growth By partnering with smaller trucking firms and fleet owners, we enable economic growth by providing an additional source of revenue for trucking operations. This keeps the operation more stable during volatile times. Data Others Can’t Provide By utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, Commoot goes above and beyond what other competitors can offer. We ‘digitize’ impression-based advertising with AI learning, making it simple and easy to deliver incredible, high-performing ads. Less Distracting Than Billboards Billboards force drivers to look 100s of feet away from the road to receive the message of the ad. Billboards are often distracting, and only hold the audience’s attention for 3-5 seconds. Commoot brings the advertisement to eye level with the driver, ensuring that their eyes are not taken off the road and the ad is seen for 10+ seconds.  Get To Know Our Process Step 1: Getting To Know Your Project We get to know you. We speak to you about your marketing needs, target demographics, budget, project goals, and more. Step 2: Creative & Goal Setting Our agency-trained creative team can design your marketing assets for you, or you can send your current billboard ads to us. We utilize high quality imagery and design to ensure that your Commoot ads are unique and memorable. Step 3: Printing and Installation Our agency-trained creative team can design your marketing assets or you can send your own over to us. We plan to utilize high quality imagery and design to ensure that your trucks are unique and memorable. Step 4: Campaign Launch! Our Commoot truck partners drive through select high-density routes, maximizing the number of possible impressions on your advertisements. Step 5: Learn From the Data We utilize machine learning and AI to understand approximately how many monthly impressions your ad received, the impression time, and many other layers of data. Step 6: Analyze and Repeat You gain a successful awareness campaign, and trucking companies earn additional income! We compile your ads’ performance and equip you with the knowledge needed to run more Commoot campaigns in new markets, to new audiences.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/33207450/,,https://twitter.com/commoot,https://www.facebook.com/commoot/
