FreshSurety,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freshsurety,http://www.freshsurety.com,"IaaS, Information Technology, Supply Chain Management","Information Technology, Software, Transportation",FreshSurety’s Supply Chain Visibility and Event Management IaaS accurately reports current value vs decay of perishable inventories,"FreshSurety’s Supply Chain Visibility and Event Management IaaS uses proprietary technology to convert any box, carton, or bag into a “Smart Container”, a self-contained chemistry laboratory.  Using this data, we apply five proprietary AI algorithms to reveal the current & future Net Present Value, NPV, of perishable foods, and natural/clean label ingredients inventory. Users can now optimize their inventory and reduce waste. Problem - Visually humans can’t determine the condition of perishable products and for Supply Chain managers decisions must be made on huge volumes of products at high velocity.  Without our technology perishables are shipped or stored with mismatched timing, the perishables quickly lose value, become unsellable and waste is the result. FreshSurety’s proprietary technology and algorithms answer three questions 1) What is the current value of my inventory? 2)   What is the Depreciation tomorrow and the day after? 3) Are there any problem events with my inventory?  Unlike our competitors, which only guess what the inventory state is based on inferior mathematical models we measure certain targeted chemical actors to determine the actual freshness state of the product.   We are the first to provide in real-time both the current and projected NPV of perishables inventory at either the order batch level or pallet level based on real data.   Supply Chain Managers get direct feedback on the current value of their inventory, not a “guess”. In the home our products work inside of refrigerators, measuring stored foods remaining nutrition value so people can make better choices of when to best consume their foods based on its actual measured state. Also, our system alarms if Microbial Contamination is detected. Value Proposition: Making the products' Current Value and Rate of Depreciation visible, we literally take money from the trash and put it back in our customers' pockets.  Business Model: Make Freshness Sensors cheap enough to give away and sell freshness IaaS NPV analysis. Our technology allows for automated real-time sampling of high-risk perishable stocks to a customer determined Acceptable Quality Level, AQL, at a 95% quality confidence level. Without FreshSurety technology only a very low confidence level <10%, (meaningless) quality inspection plans are possible. Because these plans have limited value, they are simply not performed, rendering the condition of stocks invisible and dangerous. Our technology has been demonstrated to successfully predict perishable freshness outcomes days in advance.  Competing solutions based on time & temperature technology are only right 16% of the time. FreshSurety's algorithms correctly label bad food as bad 99.3% of the time.    Our end-to-end system reduces food waste by over 1.5 tons per million dollars of retail value for Supply Chains over 5 days long and allows for automated real-time sampling of perishable stock at a 95% quality confidence level. We have gathered the world’s largest machine learning/AI training sets of perishable foods and have made many food freshness discoveries previously unknown to science. The scientists and engineers of FreshSurety have over 120 years of combined technical and business experience working on programs for defense customers and DARPA.  We put our skills to work to create a new food freshness system that doesn’t require a degree in chemistry to use.  Working with food economists we built a new end-to-end system that reports the value of perishable foods, working in real-time, automatically, 24 X 7 X 365.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/freshsurety-inc.,,,https://www.facebook.com/freshsuretyinfo/,"51,650"

The items available for purchase were created with craftsmanship and artisanship, qualities that have been sacrificed in a world of cheap prices and fast production.  Just as Whole Foods sparked a movement based on the belief that consumers should question where food comes from, Zady is creating a new vision for shopping and is at the forefront of conscious consumerism, which demands transparency for sourced products. Manufacturing transparency is at the heart of Zady; every item sold is from a designer who is conscious of where and how their products are made. Each product is personally vetted by Zady’s founders, using criteria for sustainability, including whether the product is locally-sourced, handmade, uses high-quality raw materials, is environmentally-conscious, or made in the U.S.A. The brands are required to sign a contract verifying the location of the company, the manufacturing city, and the source of the raw materials. However, consumers won’t need to compromise style for a clear conscience. All products sold on Zady are high-quality, timeless in style, and are build to last, withstanding fleeting seasonal trends and the short life-spans of poorly-made “fast fashion” items.  As such, Zady will be the arbiter of authenticity-meets-taste for this generation of conscious consumers.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/zady,,http://twitter.com/zady,http://www.facebook.com/zady,"60,202"

Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high. Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via EDI/API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers.  Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device provided by Sensor Transport. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site.  Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world.

With RideConnect, you can schedule your rides, or order a car from a simple interface. RideConnect is a ridesharing platform. Casual and commercial drivers can offer transportation directly to their riders through RideConnect, thereby keeping what money they make. With RideConnect, people in cities, towns or any other type of community can organize their own rideshare even where other car service options don't exist. Features RideBoard A centralized scheduler for rides. Riders can schedule their rides with their preferred drivers up to 24 hrs in advance. Drivers can announce their trips so that riders can ask for a ride. My Community A dynamic list of riders and drivers sourced from your private contacts. You control who's in and who's out. You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community. RideMode See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie. Best Practices Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook. You can also block people within the My Community screen in RideConnect and this will prevent them from sharing rides with you but will not remove them from your community. Be safe. Drive safe.
