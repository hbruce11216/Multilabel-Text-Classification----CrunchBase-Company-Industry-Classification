Our 8,000 employees worldwide also support our goal of creating a healthy world.

After extensive research, testing and validation the company is launching  its debut product - RESET Balance, a 99.9% nano liposomal organic hemp CBD that compliments the body’s existing endocannabinoid system. The type of advanced nanotechnology used to produce this product uses liposomes as the trojan horse of drug delivery, providing approximately a 80% absorption/CBD effect at the cellular level, the highest in the industry today.

RESET Balance is available in two flavors, neutral and peppermint, and is power packed with 300mg of organic triple tested CBD isolate, the most researched form of CBD on the market today, and importantly, with 0% THC. A unique attribute to RESET Balance is that it is white in color, due to the purity of the pharmaceutical grade lipids used.

When BACtrack was founded in 2001, breathalyzers were primarily for law enforcement use and costs were high. Keith Nothacker, CEO and Founder of BACtrack, recognized that someone could be arrested with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.08%, but that the general public had no way to test and measure their own BAC. He developed the first line of consumer breathalyzers.  PIONEERING AN INDUSTRY In 2004, BACtrack was the first company to ever receive US FDA 510(k) marketing clearance to legally sell breathalyzers to consumers for personal use. In fact, BACtrack worked with the FDA to create the evaluation and regulatory criteria for the personal breathalyzer category, which became the benchmark against which all other products were tested.  Since then, the company has worked to simplify the product, reduce the cost	of the technology, and	increase consumer awareness.	 Today, BACtrack offers a wide range of breathalyzers for both personal and professional use, and they are used by consumers, businesses, schools, clinics, hospitals, law enforcement, and even the U.S. military around the world.  DEFINING THE SMARTPHONE REVOLUTION In April, 2013, BACtrack launched the BACtrack Mobile Breathalyzer, the first smartphone breathalyzer to combine professional-grade fuel cell sensor technology, Bluetooth®-connectivity, and app-enabled features. With BACtrack Mobile, users can obtain a BAC result, view safety information and monitor how alcohol affects the body at each BAC point. BACtrack's unique ZeroLine® feature also shows a user approximately how long alcohol will remain in their bloodstream after consumption.  BACtrack released its second smartphone enabled breathalyzer in July, 2014. The BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer has many of the same features as BACtrack Mobile, but is packaged in a compact, keychain design. INDUSTRY AWARDS AND RECOGNITION BACtrack's suite of products continue to be recognized by top research and media publications. BACtrack is featured in the 2013 December issue of Popular Science. It received the 2013 Best of What's New Award (Popular Science's top honor) for its innovation in health. Popular Science stated BACtrack and the other award recipients are ""poised to change the world.""  In April 2014, the BACtrack Keychain Breathalyzer and BACtrack Mobile received Car and Driver's highest ratings in an industry wide comparison testing of the most accurate personal breathalyzers. CNET rated BACtrack Mobile as ""very good"" on the usability scale.  In the 2014 Edison Awards, BACtrack Mobile won a Bronze medal for the Security and Safety Category. It also won an Australian Good Design Award for being one of the best designed and most innovative products of the year across a range of fields and industries.  BACTRACK CONSUMPTION REPORT In June 2014, BACtrack was the first company to release alcohol related data to the public concerning US drinking habits via the BACtrack Consumption Report. The report is compiled from Blood	Alcohol	Content	(BAC) data collected anonymously via BACtrack Smartphone Breathalyzers, and will be updated regularly to provide insight into	alcohol	consumption patterns around the world. The goal	is	to	enlighten	the	general	public	on	alcohol	consumption	habits	so	that	 they 	become more responsible	drinkers. RETAIL PARTNERSHIPS BACtrack has forged extensive partnerships around the globe with the major retail and ecommerce stores. BACtrack breathalyzers are carried in over 10,000 retail locations across North America, including Best Buy, Costco, and Walgreen's, and are available at major online retailers such as Amazon, Walmart.com, Brookstone, and Drugstore.com. BACtrack products are also available in over 25 countries and 4 continents.  PRODUCT OFFERINGS The BACtrack product line includes the following: Smartphone Breathalyzers: BACtrack Mobile Smartphone Breathalyzer, BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer BACtrack smartphone breathalyzers wirelessly connect to your iOS or Android device via Bluetooth®, and with the free BACtrack app, a user can save, track, and optionally share their BAC results. Professional Series Breathalyzers:  BACtrack S80 Pro, BACtrack S75 Pro, BACtrack Element.  Each of the Professional Series breathalyzers is equipped with the proprietary Xtend Fuel Cell Sensing Technology, which deliver consistent, reliable BAC results with police-grade accuracy, from 0.000 to 0.400% BAC.
