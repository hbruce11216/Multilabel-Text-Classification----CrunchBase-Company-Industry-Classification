UberTags,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubertags,http://UberTags.com,"AgTech, Analytics, Software","Agriculture and Farming, Data and Analytics, Software",UberTags employs container tag technology to enable websites to dynamically deploy tags (code snippets) on their websites.,"UberTags built the easiest way to manage website tagging. Websites increasingly use code snippets called tags to make their websites run--tags are used for integrating analytics, marketing conversion tracking (pixels), surveys, video, widgets, A/B testing, live chat, and more.  As tag usage has increased, so has tagging pain. UberTags built a container tag solution that makes it dead-easy to manage website tagging. Site managers simply paste their UberTag across their site(s) and then deploy all other tagging right from a browser. So, for example, you can deploy conversion tags on your thank-you pages, live chat on your support site, A/B testing on your landing pages, and analytics and retargeting across every page of your site via a browser in just a few minutes.  Key benefits:  > Sites load faster! The core page loads then tags stream asynchronously. > Launch a tag in minutes instead of waiting for IT. > Centrally see your tags. See where a tag is loading and see which tags are loading on a particular page.",,,http://twitter.com/ubertags,
