Their technology sees more than 120 billion ad requests monthly. The AdHaven Platform enables 1-to1 precision targeting and measurement at scale, with no limitations, the same precision as online and direct mail advertising. At the center of the AdHaven Platform are a next-generation mobile ad server, an audience and data management platform, plus an analytics platform that combine to deliver advanced targeting and ROI. Patent Nos. 8,792,909 and 8,880,097 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office protect the technology at the core of the AdHaven Bullseye platform. 4INFO self-imposes a rigorous process to ensure the data it gathers, shares and uses to aim mobile ads at consumers is protected and near-impossible to connect to an individual. In doing so, the company incorporated privacy-by-design, a practice oft-discussed in privacy circles yet new if not unknown to most marketers. 4INFO spends at least 30% more to store data in a way that helps prevent privacy infringements than it would cost if it stowed its data in a less-secure manner. That means spreading data points associated with a specific user ID across several servers located in multiple physical locations so it cannot be compiled easily into one user profile by outside systems or hackers. In addition, AdHaven partners with the world’s leading data providers, inventory exchanges and ad sources to bridge the gap between mobile inventory and online advertising spend. 4INFO’s partnership with Acxiom allows 4INFO to offer Acxiom data within the AdHaven Bullseye product, providing direct 1:1 matches with consumer data within financial services, retail and automotive sectors. Through partnership with Datalogix, 4INFO AdHaven Bullseye can target mobile advertising on over 500 Datalogix segments, including demographic, finance, lifestyles, philanthropy, retail, seasonal, subscription services, television viewing habits and custom segments. Through partnership with Nielsen, 4INFO is able to offer Nielsen segmentation solutions, including ConneXions®, P$YCLE® and PRIZM®. ConneXions® provides consumer segments based on the combination of technology adoption, age and family structure. Nielsen P$YCLE® enables advertisers to target segments based on income producing assets and a wide variety of financial and investment behaviors. Nielsen PRIZM® provides segments based on consumer product consumption, lifestyles and purchase behaviors. 4INFO uses Nielsen Buyer Insights to directly measure the sales impact of mobile advertising campaigns, incorporating Nielsen data into the newest option within its TruView measurement platform. TruView solves a problem advertisers commonly struggle with – to measure the sales impact of their mobile advertising campaigns while sourcing sales data from hundreds or thousands of retail locations, as well as via e-commerce and m-commerce. In addition to leveraging 4INFO’s mobile technology, this TruView option enables advertisers to measure sales connected to media exposure without requiring the advertiser to provide transaction data. Through partnership with BrightRoll, 4INFO AdHaven Bullseye can target video advertising reaching audiences across web, mobile, and connected TV. In 2015, 4INFO and DMG Solutions announced a strategic alliance creating solutions to change the way marketers approach Multicultural Marketing in the United States and target specific audiences.

Automation can make your marketing appear personal. It can help make it feel more human, but algorithms using machine learning, big data, and artificial intelligence, will end up feeling exactly like that… Artificial. In today’s Amazon-ified, data scraping world, your customers begrudgingly accept trade-offs between selection, price, convenience, and “personalization” They will give away some data to get back other benefits. And that’s ok, until it isn’t... Without careful attention to detail and context, big data-driven personalization can feel more like the stalking of Big Brother than the future of retail. And to your customers—who are increasingly savvy about tracking (and therefore increasingly wary)—that means Big has become a bother—not a boon. Big tags you. Big targets you. Big mass markets at you. Big lumps you in with a bunch of people it thinks are exactly like you, and then Big tries to manipulate you. But Big is clumsy, dense, and lacks nuance. Big doesn’t care enough to remember who you are. And ironically, by missing the little details, Big misses the big picture. Your customers shop with you because you’re not Big. Because you provide a smarter, more tailor-made experience. They’re not impressed by your algorithms, they’re interested in your genuine knowledge. Knowledge about the product and service, and knowledge about them, the customer. To win their loyalty, you have to earn their trust. Which starts by showing you care enough about them to remember who they are. So, how do you do that? Don’t go Big. At Drip, our focus is on increasing sales for companies looking to build mutually beneficial relationships with B2C customers. It’s the first CRM resource built by and for ecommerce specifically. We call it ECRM and it’s a whole new way to build better, mutually-beneficial relationships with your customers at scale. It’s still true that marketing automation isn’t personal...yet. Drip is focused on continuing to define ECRM beyond its current limitations, through product evolution focused on your distinct needs and opportunities. The goal is to connect your order management system with your marketing system at the customer level in order to build better, more profitable, and real relationships with your customers.

Giving them the best tools and the ability to be fully competitive, the power to keep growing event in a bad economy, and the freedom and flexibility they are hoping to achieve. Giving the companies the edge they are looking for to grow faster.  In order to survive and succeed in this world of accelerating change, modern marketing professionals need a new generation of marketing software to help them find more future customers; to build, sustain and grow relationships with those buyers over time; and to cope with the sheer pace and complexity of engaging with customers in real-time across the web. And in many companies, marketing must knit these digital interactions together with the efforts of their colleagues on the sales team.  Marketers need to interact seamlessly with their customers across all stages of the sales funnel, and they need data and analytic insights to understand where and how to allocate their budgets for maximum return. Our software must be easy to adopt and use. Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software is fundamentally different from other kinds of business applications, like CRM, ERP and independent single point solution vendors. With those systems, the large companies typically configure them once, and then use them for months or even years with relatively little change. Marketing is much more dynamic – users need to constantly conceive, build and launch new marketing campaigns every few days or weeks, with minimum effort and no IT support. Our customers at Deskgod typically tell us that they spend one-half to one-third of the time as they did previously, which translates into much more time for them to invest in the creative aspects of their job. Our software must be powerful enough to solve real-world challenges. Modern marketing is challenging, to say the least. Marketers must control all aspects of visitors lifecycle management without of consistently switching between multiple applications like email marketing, analytics, help desk, live chat and more. Visitors are the lifeblood of the online businesses. Visitors must accurately guided to become customers, before being snatched up by competitors . And today’s marketer needs to be able to prove the results of their marketing investments, so sophisticated-yet-easy reporting and analytic tools are as important as campaign tools.  Deskgod was designed and built by real world marketing professionals who understand what marketers need to be successful. Still, Deskgod always balances powerful with easy, so that you can unleash the power when you need it, without having it in the way when you just need to get something simple done and out the door. Our software must be complete, for you and your customers. Your customers don’t care about what marketing software you use. But they will care if you use multiple disconnected systems that create a confusing user experience as they move from the web to email to live chat and beyond.  Deskgod Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software spans the entire customer experience, across every stage of the sales funnel. Looking inward toward the marketing user, only  Deskgod combines completely integrated tools for managing the entire Lifecycle of website visitors, with powerful analytic tools to make sense of it all.

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization. Increase collaboration, drive sales, build better relationships, and deliver optimized omnichannel customer experiences. The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more. Along with these two powerful features, GreenRope offers digital document signing, event management, and a learning management feature, all included with every GreenRope account.

Busy business owners don't have the money to hire expensive third-party consultants, nor do they have the technical know-how or marketing background to get value from existing solutions.

All UpLaunch solutions manage the entire client life cycle and ship with business logic, content, and software 100% ready to go. Key elements can be customized by the business owner at their leisure. However, if the customer simply wants to get up and running as fast as possible, all they have to do is fill out a simple on-boarding questionnaire and the rest...well, it just simply works.
