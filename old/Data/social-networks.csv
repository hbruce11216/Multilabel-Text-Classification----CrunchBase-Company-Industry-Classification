Homeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members. So we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly - empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities.

Myspace,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myspace,http://myspace.com,"Music, Social Media, Social Network, Web Hosting","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio","MySpace is a social networking site that enables members to make friends, write blog posts, add music, and customize their MySpace pages.","MySpace is one of the world's largest social networks, with about 125 million users. Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture.  MySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004. By February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through.  After being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010. In mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean. In late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace. In mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price. Since 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people. In June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/myspace,,http://twitter.com/MySpace,http://www.facebook.com/Myspace,"43,615"

Think of it as a massive kickstarter campaign for your love life.  We built M8 on the simple premise that the best matches come from the people who know you best. At M8, we recruit and reward your friends to become your “virtual wingman” -- who vouch for you via a written personal endorsement and then introduce you to all of their single friends.  We believe that real-life friend endorsements and introductions provide an important human dimension to our platform giving both you and your matches better insight into potential compatibility and a “warm intro” that establishes common ground. The end result? A dating app that actually does what it's supposed to do.   And by incorporating two user tracks - Dater and Matchmaker - M8 has something for everybody - whether you’re single, in a relationship, or married with kids. Also when a Dater gets into a relationship on M8, he or she can simply turn off their dating profile and play Matchmaker. The average person will actually go thru 7 to 8 relationships before finding the one.  We call this - the M8 virtuous cycle.  It's also free to get started!

Welcome to Aballoon, the first music collaboration platform, digital record label & mutual fund where artists & fans collaborate and create songs together, and where investors earn money by making this happen. Before getting into the securitization of our music royalties, I’m going to talk about our technology… We’ve built a platform that allows people from all around the globe to collaborate online through the beautiful craft of writing lyrics together, or just by writing and storing their lyrics privately. This platform is built in a way that allows us to develop internal applications like our unique music streaming service and our music encyclopedia, “Aballoopedia”. One of the best things about our platform is that it’s not only an entertainment music website where we distribute our content, it is also a space for creation & collaboration, and it functions like a social network that allows our users to share and dedicate their favorite songs from our catalog; which brings me to the next point… OUR CONTENT During the past 4 years, we’ve managed to discover and polish an outstanding formula to generate music content like no other… We have come up with a music collaboration model that even allows non-musicians to be part of music creation by writing lyrics on our platform and having well-known artists collaborate and create songs out of those lyrics through our record label, Weballooning…  And I know that you’re probably wondering what exactly is Weballooning... Weballooning is the name of our digital record label, which in other words means it is an asset generator!  Weballooning consists of arranging live music sessions where we gather musicians and artists from different bands and have them write and record a song within 48 hours, using some of the lyrics that their fans have posted on our platform. In other words, we’re the first digital record label to produce and sell music written between artists and fans. And believe me when I say that the results are mind-blowing. The sound of the songs is an unprecedented thing. We currently have more than 250,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and YouTube, and over 9.2 million plays with just 12 launched songs, and without any budget for marketing, which takes me to the next and probably the most important thing about this presentation: Music Backed Securities… We’ve already started collecting and managing music royalties out of our current songs catalog but we need liquidity to scale, That’s why after more than 2 decades of having such a financial instrument issued by David Bowie and financial innovator David Pullman, we want to retake the “Bowie Bonds” concept and turn it into the first Music Backed Securities market.  According to Billboard Magazine, Bowie Bonds were ahead of their time however, thanks to the re-emergence of the music industry and the rise of the Blockchain technology, we want to create the first financial market and mutual fund that issues and sells Asset Backed Securities collateralized by pools of songs and/or song derivatives that can serve as a new investment vehicle to be traded in our own platform or even just used as a collectible! We’ve worked and released songs with national and international famous Latin-American artists, and we’re looking to broaden our horizon by reaching out and inviting worldwide music celebrities to collaborate next. We believe that true innovation comes not only from creating great products, but creating a new mindset… That’s why for the first time ever we’re making it possible for non-musicians to be part of music creation, for big artists to collaborate and engage with their fans in a new way, and for investors to be part of the next generation of Music Backed Securities with which they’ll be able to, not only diversify their portfolios and periodically earn yields over long periods of time, but to be part of the creation of amazing music between artists and fans. Because we believe that, if a single mind has been able to create a masterpiece, imagine what we could create all together.

The service is currently in public beta at Lifeables.com. Consumers simply tell us which family members they want to include in their story, and where they keep their family content (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, DropBox).  Then their patent-pending technology automates the entire curation process, finding content only about those family members and filtering out all the rest. The technology also learns what is important to the user as they begin to ""collect"" memories.  So the more the user is on Lifeables, the more automated it becomes.  They even do the formatting for you.  Any item can be kept private or you can invite family to join you, setting privacy and sharing levels down to the individual family member.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/sproutshout-media-corporation,,http://twitter.com/lifeables,http://www.facebook.com/sproutshout,"142,046"

We don't dare to assume that we know what's best for you. Rather we feel that only you know what's best for you, even if you don't quite know it yet. DateSalad provides an online/mobile dating solution that promotes self-exploration as a means of discovering and understanding what works best for you in dating. From there, DS provides a platform from which you can be as general or as selective as you'd like in order to build your own exclusive dating experience – no matter what your preferences may be. Instead of publicizing your dating criteria for the entire dating community to see, we program the application in a way that all members outside of network never even see you – period.  Your time is scarce and therefore precious, you shouldn't have to waste it sifting through profiles of people that you would not consider dating. You also should not be inundated with emails and flirts from individuals that you clearly would have no interest in. With DateSalad, instead of being overwhelmed by the densely populated online dating market, we allow you to keenly focus on only what you want. Less distraction, more interaction, better results.  DateSalad is for the discerning individual who believes in quality over quantity. The name comes from our view on the way that dating should be - stimulating, pure, and poised to develop naturally or as we say in short, “crisp, fresh, and organic.” The name also speaks to the myriad of options that you have in online dating that we help you simplify to your tastes. There is that special someone for everyone. As such, we believe that when you know who you are and what works for you, you will know what you are looking for. With our system, the match will be mutual and more likely to produce a meaningful connection. That's why we say, """"When it's your mix, it's your match.",,,http://twitter.com/datesalad,http://facebook.com/datesalad,"142,139"

Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support.  Building off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net.  In late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Their most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success.  Released in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios.  With Forza Horizon, the Forza universe has expanded to the open road. Action racing puts the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon is the latest evolution of the authentic Forza experience. Horizon was released in late October 2012.

Logging everything in Jane produces what we call a Growlog, its kind of like a report of your grow, similar to what the Facebook timeline looks like with less pictures of family members and more pictures of colas. As we expand on the core, we have reminders, so people can get notifications on what to do and when, private picture so you don't mistakenly show your plants photos to your grandmother while showing her the vacations pictures.

As we are approaching the release of our online version, we are about to release the fundamentals of what we believe will shape the future of cannabis growing online. With Jane we will connect cannabis growers with seed breeders and fertilizer producers, the ones we believe are the real experts in cannabis growing. Using the seeds database, we can send advice's to growers about the chosen strain and breeder, when is the expected harvest date, and plan accordingly. Perhaps this strain needs less water or it gets too massive at the colas so having a strong stem will be beneficial. Using our Fertilizer Plans, you can apply the designed calendar from the fertilizer producers to your context. If you happen to be watering every 3 days, because of the weather around you, environment temperature, light height and more, we can adapt the calendar to your needs and calculate the appropriate measures to your particular situation, improving your quality of life, helping the novice to not burn their plants or mess with the ph and assist the more advanced users to save some time. Lastly we are releasing community features so growers can share, comment and like their friends grows as well as checking up what else people are growing around the world. Soon the community will be fed with hundreds of thousands of grows from all over the world and company's(seed breeders, fertilizer producers, an more) will be able to monitor how people use their products, learn from the growers themselves, get feedback on their product and improve their offering as well as to tend to issues they may have not expected from having their products being used halfway around the globe.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/growithjane/,,https://twitter.com/growithjane,https://www.facebook.com/growithjane,"169,503"

Where users can Create,Reward and Join video kindness challenges. It’s like TikTok for kindness.  Creators of Good Content are rewarded for their efforts. AWESOME has created a NEW way for you to show gratitude and instantly be rewarded by your following by receiving kindness koins. Think about if every “like” you ever received was worth 5c. AWESOME created just another way for your friends and fans to show gratitude and love for the content you are creating. Many fans don’t comment or join a video kindness challenge but they would like to show more encouragement and love than the like button provides. Here’s where they can be involved and truly reward you. Some examples of the Kindness Challenges are: Be a parking meter fairy- putting coins in expired parking meters in hopes to help someone you never meet possibly not get a ticket. OR Cupcakes for kindness- make cupcakes and show how you do it and deliver it to a neighbor or someone you just met for the first time.OR Blessings in a bag- create a bag of goodies for our less fortunate friends who are homeless. A tooth brush, tooth paste, water, vitamin-C, cookies or crackers, deodorant, and a note of encouragement and love. Kindness Koins- is a virtual digital currency that users receiving can redeem for gift cards to Groceries and Shopping around the world. Stores like like Amazon, Apple, PlayStation, Starbucks, Target Plus all your favorite restaurants or delivery apps or gift cards to support the dozens of charities listed.(20KK=1$US) To “get more” Kindness Koins for free users can watch rewarded ads or users can purchase as many as they wish in bundles.  As you participate in AWESOME you earn points and level up with your halo growing brighter and changing colors. Exchange points for animated upgrades in the virtual store. Try Inviting friends and followers to join you in a kindness challenge making the world more Awesome, then award them kindness koins. Invite followers to follow from other platforms by gifting kindness koins. There are unlimited opportunities to reward and award the use of the kindness koins. Imagine microfunding charities in fundraising kindness challenges or funding teachers classrooms by celebrating teachers' challenges they share for their class. Churches can help the underprivileged microfunding for materials and food for families in need.

Aqqaint,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aqqaint,https://www.aqqaint.com,"E-Commerce Platforms, Marketplace, Sharing Economy, Social Network","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Other",Trust Networks for the Sharing Economy,"Aqqaint fundamentally changes the way individuals and organizations think of trust in the sharing economy by delivering the first platform to incorporate interpersonal trust and online reputations in a meaningful way.   Aqqaint is a trust networking platform that allows anyone to exchange products, services, and reviews safely.  Our service extends our member's reputation beyond first-degree connections to build powerful networks without sacrificing trust, for the sharing economy. People want to make and save money sharing the stuff they own or selling their goods or services to others in need.  This is evidenced by the 157 million users who visit peer-to-peer classified sites each month.  In fact, the sharing economy is expected to top $335 billion by 2025.  The other important factor for individuals is trust.  92% of people surveyed trust recommendations from people they, more than any other source.  Trust is built on four key fundamentals; credibility, reliability, intimacy, and understanding motivation.  All of these are built over time and through repeated activity.  So, it’s no wonder that we trust people we know more than strangers. While there are a handful of options to facilitate these peer-exchanges they all completely ignore or poorly handle the role of trust.  This has created an environment of anonymity and zero accountability on the ends of the buyer or seller.  On some platforms it has created an environment conducive to scams and violent crimes.  On others it has created a negative incentive for sellers to propagate fake or highly-incentivized reviews to drive sales. 70% of Americans report shopping online and spent more than $452 billion last year alone. Environmental factors and stagnant wages for the middle class are driving people to save money and live sustainable lifestyles.  Millennials in particular are driven to make their dollar count.  So reliable reviews and a safe means to buy or borrow used goods and services is extremely valuable. Aqqaint delivers an environment that removes the uncertainty from the current sharing economy and peer-review systems through trust networks curated by our members which extend their real-life reputation to the web.  Aqqaint’s members build a powerful network of trusted individuals as they can exchange with anyone, they share a direct or mutual connection with.  Additionally, organizations such as schools, non-profits, corporations, etc can establish customized “Aqqaint Communities”, trust networks, for their members or employees which add value, engagement, and increase retention.  These trust networks can be used to exchange goods, services, or share reviews.   Overview: Aqqaint provides all the functionality you would find in an online classified tool such as LetGo, OfferUp, or Craiglist, plus a patent-pending AI-assisted Trust Scoring Machine (TSM) that evaluates and scores individual users trustworthiness based on common interpersonal trust traits, user feedback, and outside information.   Members start by connecting with people or organizations they trust, and then in a similar fashion to LinkedIn, Aqqaint displays mutual connections where to expand the power of that members sharing network.  From there members can buy, sell, loan, rent, look for and share reviews with one another.   Who’s on Aqqaint: Aqqaint’s trust networks are made up of a combination of individuals from all walks of life.  We have college students just starting out to baby boomers looking to downsize.  The primary demographic that Aqqaint is seeing the highest engagement from are 21-35-year-old’s who are familiar with the sharing economy and want to make an impact through their personal consumption behavior.   We have also seen great interest from community leaders who are looking to create trust networks on Aqqaint for their organizations.  They are focused on adding value for members and boost retention rates.  Some of which have paid memberships for their particular organization. Currently, we have a neighborhood association, a parent teacher organization for a local school, a major U.S. University with more than 15,000 members including students and alumni, and a federal union with over 1 million members. All have actively demonstrated their intention to take advantage of our community feature.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/18679951/,,https://www.twitter.com/aqqaint,https://www.facebook.com/aqqaint,"297,599"

Through uniting all devices CLEVR restores a fragmented market and adds a layer of discovery through viral channels. CLEVR has solved two problems…. 1)  Solved Fragmentation and Social.  CLEVER brought a fragmented VR market and fragmented social landscape into one unified HUD.  As we have all heard time and time again, ""mobile is fragmented.""  Virtual Reality only magnifies the problem. CLEVR has the solution. First, we've reversed engineered our way into every VR platform and brought together the connectivity, all devices can now talk to each other.  Secondly, CLEVR has taken all of the various social networks you use (Facebook, Slack, WhatsApp, etc) and brought those APIs into one feed, one single HUD.  All of your social connections are now in one single view. 2)  Made VR content discoverable.  We've done this through two approaches.  First, in our stand alone app, CLEVR displays what games your friends are currently enjoying and playing AND on which platform.  Secondly, we're creating an in-game HUD (SDK) for developers to use where players can pop up the CLEVR social network, within the content itself (games, movies, etc) thus allowing players to shout out to their friends on their social graph and invite them to the game.  Now VR content is discoverable through your social graph. SOLUTION/PRODUCT To the point, CLEVR is a social platform that unites all VR devices and allows users to discover new content (games, movies, any VR content).  A lot of buzzwords, yes. But every generation of platforms the same discoverability issues emerge. CLEVR is taking advantage of the black hole in the market and has taken first mover advantage.",,,,,"305,828"

The company relaunched their product in January 2007 with enhanced sharing capabilities and a free 1GB version meant to entice users who are not ready to pay $55 per year for unlimited storage. The company found that the first version of its service didn't make it easy enough for its 11,000 paying members to share their hosted media with each other. Sharing usually had to be done by manually emailing password-protected links to family and friends. These emails would get lost, and with them, the URLs and passwords contained within. The new version of Phanfare addresses this issue by integrating social networking functionality that enables users to create connections with one another and specify which content they want to make available to their Phanfare contacts. The photo sharing capabilities are very similar to Facebook's, although users have more control on who sees which particular content. Phanfare also allows users to store photos and videos in a application on the desktop. It then syncs the media automatically with the web. Currently, this desktop client is only available for the PC but the company has been working on a version for the Mac as well.  Akin to [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com/), Phanfare converts the videos to Flash allowing them to be easily viewed online; users can also download them in their original form. There is also no Phanfare Facebook application or iPhoto plugin, but these too may be available in the future. A plethora of other competitors offer desktop photo storage and management applications. Some include: [Shutterfly](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Shutterfly), [Snapfish](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Snapfish), [Kodak](http://www.kodakgallery.com/Welcome.jsp), and [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/).

Todayter,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/todayter,http://todayter.com,"Dating, Social Media, Social Network","Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",Todayter provides same day installation service of noise deadening materials and window armoring.,"Todayter is an introduction-based dating network that keeps the wonder of love wide open, without sacrificing your time and privacy. TODAYTER IS A DATING NETWORK Browsing through dating sites can often feel like you're bouncing like a ball through a pinball machine. There are plenty of dating sites that, at least initially, open their doors to anybody. We're told to choose our friends carefully, so why not be a little more choosy about our dating community? The solution is simple: by implementing an introduction-based dating network, Todayter ensures your online time will be much more productive and hassle free; a place where you meet the people you want to meet. No spammers, scammers or Internet trolls. The objective is not to eliminate the old paradigm, but rather to improve upon it. People donâ€:tm:t want their contact information distributed amongst the entire Internet. Todayter is a dating network that strangers canâ€:tm:t see, search, or subvert. This prevents non-members from viewing profiles or a list of our current members. The wonder of love should be kept wide open, but that doesnâ€:tm:t mean your dating network has to be. THE DATING GAME We know that dating can often feel like a big torturous game. Todayter lets you be the ultimate player. In an effort to transcend some of the negative stigma linked to online dating, we reward all efforts made on Todayter. We award points based on your dating skills, hard work, and dedication. This opens the gates to another part of someone's personality, reflected in the badges theyâ€:tm:ve earned for their activity, adding unique value to a profile. Todayter also recognizes that personalities are too vast and complicated to organize and calculate them through the use of lengthy formulas and surveys. A dating site's idea of a ""perfect match"" is not always the ""perfect match"". By implementing a dating feedback system, members will be able to see how they stack up against the rest. We let people rate their dates, so you don't just have to take their word for it. Datability Feedback isn't based on somebody's idea of compatibility, but focuses on human behavior and the way people act socially, holding people accountable for their actions as well as their words. It takes some of the guesswork out of dating. FEATURES â€¢    Rewards-  Specially designed badges are awarded to members for a variety of actions, such as signing up, inviting friends, going on dates, getting good ratings, and using the site regularly. Gift Certificates will be distributed monthly for reaching invitation/sign-up records. â€¢    Date Feedback- After each date, both daters will be given the opportunity to fill out a feedback questionnaire rating the person they went on a date with. Datability scores will be displayed on all member profiles, adding accountability and value to each member. â€¢    Crush List- If you find someone particularly intriguing, you may add them to your Crush List, they will be notified and will then be available to request a date from them. â€¢    Todayter Blog- All blog material provided by in house blog curator, Sarah Roxanne Shields (sarahrox), highlighting dating culture trends and other various relationship-related material. Guest Submissions are welcome. THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF LOVE Common interests are important, but on most dating sites everything you learn about someone is based entirely on what the person decides to reveal. Weâ€:tm:ve tried to design a profile that will allow you to tell people something about yourself while avoiding the superficial questions that litter other popular dating sites. The true purpose of Todayter is to bring people together. Todayter promotes the face-to-face aspect of dating, which is going on actual dates. Because that's when the true connection is made. That's when you know where things are going, and where they aren't. It's a chemical fact. There are three chemicals which complete the trifecta of the feeling we call love: Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Oxytocin. In relationships, these chemicals create, motivate and sustain us all. But in order to experience them, we need physical contact. We need to see, hear, and smell. The culture of love is becoming too introverted, too virtual. Todayter's goal is to act as a catalyst for real-life love connections, encouraging people to meet up and rewarding them for it. Only then will we trigger the biological system that fuels romantic connections and allow the chemicals of love to surge into action.",,,http://twitter.com/todayter,https://www.facebook.com/todayter,"317,153"

DECIDE - Review the votes, make your decision, and share the outcome of your decision with everyone who voted. Launch a WeeAct campaign around any decision using text and pictures. Here are some example decisions that WeeAct can help you make: - Fashion: What outfit should I wear? - Lifestyle: Which haircut should I get? - Consumer: What brand should I buy? - Blogging: Which tutorial should I post next on my blog? - Events: Which party should I go to tonight? - Design: What color should I paint my room? - Investing: Which stock should I buy? - Romance: Who should I go out on a date with? - Education: Which class should I enroll in? - Fitness: What should I do for my workout? - Health: What food should I eat on my diet? - Social: Which picture should I use in my profile? WeeAct Benefits: ● Create a decision campaign and harness the wisdom of the crowd in just seconds. ● Don't passively browse content. Participate in the decision-making of other users by voting on their choices and inspiring them to act. ● Stop scrolling through feeds of content that you don't care about. Automatically personalize your feed on WeeAct because every time you vote on a decision, you'll receive relevant content that shows the outcome. ● Stop wasting time looking at ads. WeeAct does not support or show ads anywhere on the app and all of our content is crowd-sourced by regular, everyday people, just like you! ● Think you give good advice? See for yourself using WeeAct's Voting Accuracy which tracks how often what you picked is the choice that gets made. ● Get feedback without the noise. Harassment is a major issue on some apps, but on WeeAct users cannot message each other and no one can post comments on campaigns. ● Create content your audience wants. Make your audience feel like they are part of the creative decision-making process by crowd-voting your content on WeeAct. ● Use our 5-star rating system to rate each other's decisions based on the success or failure of the outcome. ● Increase your vote totals by sharing your WeeAct campaigns on different social networks. ● WeeAct is committed to protecting all user data on our application. We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. The Human Intelligence App: WeeAct has been designed to take advantage of human intelligence by eliminating biases that exist within the crowd. Each voter is ambiguous to the decision-maker, which allows people to vote, honestly, based on their own experiences with that decision. The crowd becomes smarter as more votes are cast on any single decision by eliminating these biases. If life is just a series of decisions, WeeAct is too valuable of a utility not to use. If you struggle to make decisions, WeeAct will revolutionize your life. Download our app for free today and start making smarter decisions . . . together. Got feedback?

PlayerMania.com can be described as a combination of Myspace, Facebook and ESPN. It enables athletes to set up a sports profile which displays information about all the sports they play and where they played them. The site even goes as far as letting them link up to current and past high school and college teams by the season that they played. David Wolf, a former division 3 basketball player and founder of PlayerMania.com, believes that pro's shouldn't be the only ones getting all the recognition.  You don't have to be a pro to be a great player. ""There are so many great players out there not making millions of dollars, and it's time to bring them together"", Wolf said. ""We are looking for players who are playing, have played or plan on playing in high school and college."" PlayerMania.com is dedicated to the people out there that play for the love of the game. Wolf came up with the idea of the site after finishing college and finding it hard to find competitive leagues and great players. ""I would go to the local gym and maybe half of the guys could play; that's not fun when you're used to playing against some really great players."" ""I also hated how hard it was to find leagues in my area. I would have to go to every park district's web site and dig through all the programs just to find the basketball league"", Wolf added. The site solves these issues with its advanced player search and league search feature. The site, which is entirely free, also allows players to write their own sports articles. If you ever wanted to be a sports writer, this is your chance. A really cool feature on the site is that it allows players to rate their friends at various categories of the sports they play. This makes it possible to do a search for a specific player based on rating. This feature works great if, for example, you are starting a recreational basketball team and need a center that can rebound and block shots. Now you can just search for centers in your area with high ratings in rebounds and blocks. Every member also gets a virtual trading card with their uploaded photo that flips 360 degrees. If you're a golfer, you can add your scores and the site will figure out your handicap and rank. Wolf says that there are a lot more features in the works. He aims to make this site the center of every player's life.",,,http://twitter.com/PlayerMania,http://www.facebook.com/pages/PlayerManiacom/168017555581,"418,629"

Compared to for-profit businesses, nonprofits face significant double standards when it comes to overhead expenditure. Most donors have a visceral aversion to overheads, wanting a majority of their donation to go directly to the cause and not towards compensation, advertising & marketing spend, investment in IT and innovation etc. Sadly, this 'Overhead Myth' is crippling the nonprofit sector, stagnating innovation and destroying growth potential. ​It seems counterintuitive that the very organizations that have altruistically committed themselves to making the world a better place, are often constrained from maximally doing so! ​We empower nonprofits to break free from the ""The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle"" by providing services that help them not just to survive, but to grow! Rather than handouts, we provide leg-ups in areas that they need it most.  Here's how it works: 1) Consumers purchase products from our ecommerce partners 2) A set percentage from each sale is paid by these businesses to Virtueconomy 3) ​We then convert those funds into valuable services for the matched nonprofit partner As a male founder, it was important to me to become an ally and stand up for the gender inequality that continues to persist in the business world.  As such, Virtueconomy's initial focus is on Women Empowerment -- We create shared value by matching female founded enterprises with relevant nonprofits that empower, educate and uplift women.",,,https://www.twitter.com/virtueconomy,https://www.facebook.com/virtueconomy,"436,791"

Making a difference."" About55 has over 1,200 members who are discovering the resources they need for mid-life self-renewal, and we are just getting started! Our model has several revenue channels, is inherently social, solves a big and recurring consumer need, and is aimed at dominating a mid-life self-renewal market which is dramatically under-served by the competition. Where We Came From About55 was created from the observation of two colliding trends. the rise in economic stress among those in mid-life and the rapid adoption of social media among those in this same group. Many of the current problems being experienced by those in mid-life are clearly visible, such as foreclosure and unemployment. But many of the real symptoms brought on by these events are often hidden and not discussed because those involved are often embarrassed and are caught off-guard by their current situation. To add to their stress, many have also lost much of their peer support because their circle of friends were broken due to these same circumstances. This loss of support and the resulting loneliness has added additional stress to their lives. So, how are these problems brought to the forefront of discussion and resolved? About55 provides a community of peers, expert support and the tools needed to unlock the talents and skills possessed by our membership. A place for our members to grow, explore, renew and celebrate their accomplishments. The formula for self-renewal is proven. The Well-known psychological theorist, Carl Jung, suggest that ""the successful resolution of mid-life problems either comes from an increase in self-growth, a new vocation, or often both"". Our business niche is to facilitate the delivery of the products and services needed for self-renewal via social marketplace and knowledge sharing platform.   Why We Will Succeed About55 has the right focus at exactly the right time. We bring together and match the needs of our members who are seeking self-renewal resources with experts who can deliver career, life, and relationship coaching. Our solution is a social marketplace that fulfills both the needs of the buyer and the targeted audience sought by the sellers.",,,http://twitter.com/about55,http://www.facebook.com/retirementmedia,"455,215"

To that end, ekko provides media companies, content-oriented social networks, and aggregators with a hosted, modular and customizable platform to enable multi-user communication and discussion right within their sites. Using any or all of the ekko platform modules, sites can provide their communities a branded experience with active conversation through broadcast discussions, text (IM), video and/or audio.
