The primary goal is to create a world-wide network that can transport real-time communications over secure standards-based channels and make it all accessible to developers and businesses using simple SDKs and programming interfaces designed to be powerful but simple-to-use. Audio/Video applications can be built with SignalWire that run in the mobile browser with no additional software and allow an experience that can unlock communications with a virtual office, AI bots, PSTN termination, gateways to remote call centers and much more.  With the evolving mobile SDK, rich applications can be built as native apps and the other side of every call is not just a ""room"" but a full-fledged routable telecommunications backend with additional programmable control for every call. SignalWire is founded on the principle of work-from-anywhere dating back to the turn of the century and continues that tradition with a fully distributed workforce spanning 16 US states and 11 countries in nearly every inhabited time zone. This remote culture has helped to shape the way our products and services have evolved and have proved to be invaluable amid the pandemic crisis in 2020. The core of SignalWire is made up of several networked nodes transforming the computing power of its host system into IP-based telecommunications relays that are demand-driven and horizontally scalable. The breadth of the SignalWire technology ranges from mature interfaces like SIP and PSTN to the state-of-the-art techniques in live video and HD audio. Unlike many ""video chat"" products and services, SignalWire goes well beyond basic capabilities and has dissected every moving part into programmable components that are on the bleeding edge of what is possible. SignalWire is evolving quickly into the first and only software-powered global telecommunications company delivering that as a service at the Infrastructure, Platform, and Application layer of today's communication stack landscape.

Broadwing Communications was founded in 1962 as Tower Communications Systems, Inc, originally a microwave communication provider. That company became IXC Communications in 1994. When Cincinnati Bell acquired IXC Communications in 1999, the merged company was renamed Broadwing. Broadwing Corporation operates two divisions that serve different segments of the telecommunications industry. The communications division, managed by the Broadwing Communications, LLC subsidiary, is a provider of data, internet, voice, and broadband transport services to carrier and enterprise customers delivered over a nationwide network connecting 137 cities. The communications equipment division, operating under Corvis Equipment Corporation, designs, manufactures, and sells high performance all-optical and electrical/optical communications systems. In response to the severe downturn in the telecommunications industry, the company shifted its focus to become primarily a provider of communications services, which comprises about 99 percent of its revenue. In 2003, Cincinnati Bell reclaimed its former name, selling its competitive carrier operations—Broadwing—to equipment manufacturer Corvis. In 2004, Corvis acquired Focal Communications, folded Focal into Broadwing Communications’ operations, and used that opportunity to change the name of Broadwing Communications’ parent company from Corvis Corporation to Broadwing Corporation. On October 16, 2006, Broadwing Corporation announced an agreement to be acquired by Level 3 Communications, and the deal to close in the first quarter of 2007.",,,,,"126,615"

(AFO). AFO is a privately-held company based in North Salt Lake, Utah under the shadows of the majestic Wasatch mountains. AFO was founded in 1993 with the intent of introducing high standards of aerospace fiber optic engineering practices to the US telecommunications industry. By 1995, AFO founders had successfully achieved their goal and were supporting fiber optic splicing and testing operations throughout the western United States. Those field service offerings continue today, and have expanded to include fiber characterization testing throughout the United States. As AFO began its field service operations, it became obvious to the founders that there had to be a better way to document fiber optic networks. At the conclusion of nearly every fiber optic project AFO would be asked to prepare binders full of paper records that would summarize the work that had been done so that it could be combined with other binders of records to serve as documentation for the project. The problem was, the outside plant data within those binders was not easy to get to, let alone analyze to help make insightful decisions. Thus, the birth of the idea of OSPINSIGHT. By 1996 OSPINSIGHT software products were being distributed to AFO customers to help them better understand and interact with their network documentation. The move towards paperless documentation was underway. Since that time, millions of strands of fibers have been documented in OSPINSIGHT products throughout the world. And, the passion to develop, distribute , and support software applications to more efficiently and effectively document fiber optic networks moves forward today.",https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ospinsight/,,https://twitter.com/OSPInSight,https://www.facebook.com/ospinsight,"137,876"

The company expanded tremendously in 1998 through the acquisition of a number of Internet and cable companies. Then, beginning in 2005, management focused on RCNâ€:tm:s strategic Northeast Corridor and Chicago markets, selling non-core assets including its 49% stake in Megacable, the largest cable company in Mexico, as well as its West Coast assets. With close to a decade of experience providing cable TV, Internet and phone service using fiber optics already under its belt, RCN again grew significantly in 2006. First, the company acquired Con Edison Communications (CEC), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., with its own fiber-optic network in New York City. The combination of CEC with RCNâ€:tm:s existing business services capability created the subsidiary RCN Business Solutions. Second, RCN completed a substantial network upgrade, including conversion to a 100% digital network. In 2007, RCN Business Solutions acquired NEON Communications gaining an advanced fiber-optic network stretching across twelve northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. NEON was a wholesale service provider of high-bandwidth transport services to service providers and Fortune 100 companies. With this acquisition, RCN Business Solutions became RCN Metro Optical Networks, a leading facilities-based provider to medium and large carriers and enterprises in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Chicago metro area.  RCN entered a new phase in 2008. Now equipped with two business units, Residential and Small Business and RCN Metro Optical Networks, serving three customer segments, the company continues to win customers in its markets. RCN is accelerating its movement to an all-digital video platform, enabling an increase in high-definition availability and improving picture quality to cable TV customers, and is continuing to offer the fastest high-speed Internet available with cable modem speeds that challenge industry standards. RCNâ€:tm:s past success stems from its foresight in acquiring, maintaining and growing its expansive fiber-optic network to serve multiple customer segments with an unwavering commitment to offering premium services with the very best in value.

Rivada Networks provides advanced communications solutions to the public safety community at local, state and federal levels.  Rivada Networks' technologies enable public safety agencies to retain absolute control over their own dedicated broadband networks, while enabling the generation of valuable revenues from unused capacity, when available. Following the events of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated dedicated radio spectrum in the 700 Mhz band, to US public safety. The legislation allows for non-priority access to the spectrum for competitive commercial users.  Rivada’s core technology, Dynamic Spectrum Arbitrage Tiered Priority Access (DSATPA) works out to the very edge of the network, allowing public safety absolute priority access with instant (millisecond) pre-emption in the event of an emergency situation – thus guaranteeing first responders access to the highest quality bandwidth capacity at the moment they need it most. Meanwhile, in the extended periods of time when the public safety broadband network has significant extra bandwidth to spare, DSATPA allows that capacity to be dynamically auctioned in a fully competitive 'on demand' process to competing commercial entities – providing more choice and availability to industry and consumers while generating essential revenue for the public safety mission. DSATPA is a game changer for the way in which spectrum is consumed, maximising the efficiency of the radio spectrum bandwidth resource and unlocking the potential for more extensive high capacity broadband networks.  Rivada has served public safety for a decade, helping to meet their unique and critical communications challenges. Rivada Networks' work has been recognised for helping to save lives during times of severe crisis, such as Hurricane Katrina and multiple other emergencies and disasters. Rivada Networks' commitment to helping the men and women who stand on the front lines of emergency situations is absolute and their dedicated team of innovators work tirelessly to bring their unparalleled expertise to the task.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivada-networks,,https://twitter.com/RivadaNetworks,,"145,584"
