The company has been partnered with Shell Energy to demonstrate this disruptive technology. It uses low-cost chemical energy to accelerate consumable projectiles to hypersonic velocities, allowing projectiles upon impact to break and pulverize hard rock faster, deeper, and through a wider range of conditions. It uses this same HyperCore technology to create the Hyper Tunneling Boring and Mining system (HTBM), replacing conventional tunneling methods which typically are slow, and significant capital expense. In most cases, each consumable projectile removes over half a ton of rock per impact.  When applied to deep geothermal energy, the drilling system allows for low-cost access to deep energy. The ""Energy Anywhere""​ geothermal system generates power by quickly and efficiently reaching untapped geothermal resources and converting it into electrical energy that will cause a significant paradigm change in renewable, clean energy.  In 2018 HyperSciences secured a contract with NASA by applying the key components of HyperCore's automated system in order to launch payloads to high-altitudes at extreme velocity. By lowering the cost for hypersonic vehicle development and a new type of stealth program, the system is prepared to support USA government contracts in the aerospace community.

With a focus on creating unique furniture showcasing international flavor, functional design, and sustainable materials, Arhaus furniture brightens any room with inspired decor. Arhaus designers search the world looking for eclectic designs and pieces to share with clients and customers at Arhaus locations, bringing back vivid furniture from master artisans. Arhaus was founded in 1986 by Jack Reed and his son John. The first store opened in downtown Cleveland as part of the Flats district in a building from the 1840s; thirty years later Arhaus now has locations in over 25 states. The store’s name was inspired by the Danish city Aarhus; after seeing the name, John Reed found a variation that conveyed an international feeling, combining his original inspiration with the German word for house. Jack Reed had a vision of a company that would sell unique products sourced from all over the world. Arhaus has partnered with vendors for over twenty years to ensure quality and consistency; vendors become more than just business partners, they become friends and family as both businesses expand. CEO John Reed says, “as we grow, they grow.” Arhaus works with vendors across the world to find handcrafted one-of-a-kind products. Amish-Americans in Ohio dry wood for years to create the Live Edge collection; iron artisans in Mexico forge iron frames for bar stools by hand. Arhaus buys directly from manufacturers who share the Arhaus vision for quality, design, and sustainability. Since the beginning of the company Arhaus has been committed to sustainability, and today Arhaus demonstrates those values through a philanthropic partnership with American Forests. Arhaus has never used wood from endangered forests in their furniture–all of the wood used today is sustainably sourced or recycled. Almost half of the raw materials used to create Arhaus products are recycled, including glass, metal, and wood.

Teaching coursework on entrepreneurship and accounting to up-and-coming business professionals, Rob was challenged by a student who wondered whether bulletproof armor could be made lighter and more flexible. After many years of research and over $10 million dollars in funding, the answer is UNEQUAL, a revolutionary composite that promises to reduce the pain and injury associated with impacts. The multilayer product was originally developed for military applications, and was tested under incredibly stringent guidelines issued by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the organization that certifies bullet-resistant armor. UNEQUAL’s unique composite material, fortified with DuPont Kevlar® aramid fibers, works by stopping bullets and dispersing the impact energy of projectiles, helping the wearer to remain safe. The shock-blocking technology served to protect the wearer from impact injuries and bullet wounds sustained on the battlefield, and was adopted by soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and government agents. The technology behind these innovative products is backed by over 85 U.S. and international patents and extensive testing from independent, accredited laboratories the world over. OEM facilities and university science programs have verified the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing protective gear. The product was soon applied to the task of protecting those involved in professional sports. It first found favor in pro sports among NFL players, who flocked to the company’s protective wear. Now, the protective products can be found in body armor and helmet padding among dozens of players in the football league, and other sports governing bodies like the NHL and Major League Baseball have begun to use the products to help protect players. For action sports like the X Games, the lightweight protective products are ideal in that they protect against injuries while remaining flexible and easy to wear, even in extreme conditions. The protective head and body gear is vastly superior to other protective products on the market, especially those constructed of plastic and foam. The layered composite material in UNEQUAL’s protective product line is tough and resilient, able to withstand the abuse that collision and action sports can create. Collegiate and youth athletes in disciplines like baseball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, and football can benefit from the protection UNEQUAL’s products provide. Products are designed to be affordable and can be customized for specific sporting applications and body types, giving the athlete tremendous flexibility while warding off the injuries and pain associated with sports impacts. UNEQUAL and its products have received several prominent awards for innovation in the field of protective sportswear. The company was recognized by Forbes as one of the magazine’s 100 Most Promising Companies. Thanks to our work with DuPont, the manufacturing company presented UNEQUAL with its Kevlar® Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, Esquire, ESPN, and Inc. Magazine all listed the company and its products among the most important tech innovations for the year. The industry publication Composites Manufacturing called the company “The Industry’s Best” that same year, showcasing the protective gear’s growth from military origins to sporting applications and its future in protecting actors in movie and television productions, among many other roles.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/unequal-technologies-company,,https://twitter.com/unequaltech,https://www.facebook.com/UnequalTech,"43,278"

The Oberon production units use various feedstocks—such as biogas (animal and food waste, wastewater treatment, landfills), natural gas, and stranded gas—and they produce 3,000–10,000 gallons of DME per day. The Oberon process cost-effectively converts methane to DME, resulting in stable pricing (not dependent on crude oil), at a price that is competitive with diesel. The modular design can be deployed to remote stranded-gas locations that can be difficult and expensive to harvest, and to industrial operations where our units can monetize waste CO2 streams. These small-scale Oberon production units enable the development of regional fuel markets that service local customers engaged in regional haul, so initially we bypass the need for a national infrastructure.  In addition, capital expenditures are in sync with market growth. As the DME market develops, more small-scale production units will be deployed in each region and new regions will be added across North America. While DME has been in development for several decades, market forces such as increasing emission regulations, the spread between natural gas and crude oil pricing, and innovations in processing technology make now an exciting time to commercialize DME particularly in the heavy-duty trucking sector.

Our system is deployable within 30 days providing North American trucking fleets with the lowest cost, highest return, barrier free alternative fuel system available, allowing them a significant return on investment while achieving sustainability targets.  By partnering with major industry players to leverage their capabilities, Optimus will deliver a fully integrated client solution that is rapidly scalable, creating a $279MM company by 2023. MARKET OPPORTUNITY In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.   Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.   WHY INVEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES:  We are the most competitive alternative fuel system available.  Directly competing technologies such as CNG, and the emerging segment of electric trucks have high barriers to entry including long lead times, high technology and infrastructure costs, and limitations on long-haul adaptability. Our infrastructure costs are at most, 10% of competing technologies.  Our integrated solution is rapidly scalable, integrating seamlessly with existing equipment and infrastructure and our range equates to and can exceed diesel technology.

Our cases are dedicated to all the klutzy, spontaneous, chaotic, graceless individuals who have broken a device or valuable due to their active lifestyle and like our customers, we've been there too! The ""innovative spirit"" of founder and chairman Curt Richardson has promoted the development of our product lines from waterproof boxes into four lines of device-specific cases for today's hottest technologies. Similar to an otter's fur, our original line of cases is waterproof. So to incorporate that element with the fun and playful disposition of the animal our founder and his wife came up with the name OtterBox while brainstorming company names during a drive to Denver, Colo. Like the animal that is our namesake, we're a fun, creative bunch that likes to work hard and play hard too. We have in-house sales, customer service, accounting, engineering, public relations, marketing, web design, graphics, supply chain, human resources and our own warehouse. OtterBox is located in one of the greatest cities in America - Fort Collins, Colo. Ranked #1 in 2006 and #2 in 2008 on Money Magazine's ""Best Places to Live"" list, Fort Collins has easy access to the Rocky Mountains for biking, hiking, running, camping, kayaking, boating, skiing, snowboarding and other activities. Many of us use our cases every day, in the office, outdoors and around town and serve as excellent ""guinea pigs"" for new product testing. Throughout the years, we've listened to customer feedback and attribute the evolution of our products to consumers who've challenged us to take the idea of a protective case to the next level. At OtterBox, it's not one person changing the world of cases, it's a team!",https://www.linkedin.com/company/otterbox,,http://twitter.com/OtterBox,http://www.facebook.com/otterbox,"49,065"
