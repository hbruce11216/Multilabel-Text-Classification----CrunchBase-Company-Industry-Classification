We call it ""the event-based security model"". Most of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs. When integrated with urban services, Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to 911 if there are signs of violence or incipient crime.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/18415519/,,http://twitter.com/FaceterOfficial,https://www.facebook.com/FaceterOfficial/,"26,831"

A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com. RailsBridge relies on Terminal.com to teach first-time female engineers to code Ruby on Rails.  Top consultants at ZS Associates crunch numbers on our platform for data science tasks every day.  Professors at Carnegie-Mellon use Terminal.com to teach 100-student courses with no wasted effort.  Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs.

In short, Giant Gray helps dramatically improve business operational awareness and incident response for its customers – as well as prevent costly interruptions and breakdowns – through its Graydient technology platform with applications in industrial (SCADA/ICS), physical security and surveillance, and cybersecurity environments.

These real-time insights allow customers to make operational adjustments before early-warning signals grow into true incidents that impact safety, security, and business operations.

Atomicorp includes GotRoot labs, which was formed in 1998 by the founders of Atomicorp and has since been merged with Atomicorp and is no longer a separate entity (same personnel, assets, and location). The founders of Atomicorp are industry recognized experts in the field of cyber security and prior to forming Atomicorp, were co-founders of Plesk and members of the Wheelgroup team that developed first commercial network intrusion detections system which was subsequently acquired by Cisco and made the basis for their IDS security offerings (see Management Team descriptions below). The Atomicorp team has pioneered a number of new approaches to security. They are the inventors of “Just in Time” or “Virtual” patching (JTIP). JITP is a method of developing virtual patches for applications before a vendor has released a security fix. JITP allows an end-user of the vulnerable application to continue to use it in a secure manner without needing to wait for the vendor to release an official patch. In many cases where JITP is properly deployed, the user may never need to patch the application. Atomicorp also pioneered methods such as layer 7 protocol scrubbing and the use of regular expression engines to simplify the creation of new signatures for Intrusion Detection systems. Another innovation of Atomicorp is distributed vulnerability assessments through light weight automatically deployed “dumb agents”, and later through direct remote-command control of systems.",,,https://twitter.com/atomicorp,https://www.facebook.com/atomicorp,"43,227"

It is the first company of its kind to provide enterprise-grade security to hybrid HTML5 Cordova mobile apps with such astonishingly fast deployment. The Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform consists of five core services: Appmobi Security Kit, Secure Push Messaging, Secure Live Update, Secure Analytics and Secure Data Store. The platform easily integrates and works with a developer’s existing development tools, providing the mobile services required to build truly secure hybrid apps in an easy-to-install package – all hosted on an enterprise’s private cloud or on premise.  Originally founded in April 2006, the Appmobi Software Development Kit (SDK) was acquired by Intel® in February 2013. The transferred technology now forms the basis of the Intel® XDK, which allows developers to build optimized HTML5 applications for mobile platforms. Appmobi maintains a partnership with Intel® that makes the Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform available to Intel® XDK developers, enabling the development of secure mobile apps via Intel’s best-in-class HTML development environment.  Based in San Francisco and Poughkeepsie, NY, Appmobi is a privately held company backed by Aspire Ventures.  Appmobi History: In 2007 Appmobi was the developer of the most popular streaming media web app on the iPhone - FlyTunes.fm. In the following years, Appmobi was also a leading provider of streaming media technology, including cross-platform apps, to the largest US radio broadcasters. In August 2011, Appmobi made available the Appmobi XDK (cross platform development kit) which allowed developers to use HTML5 technology to create fully functional mobile apps that run across different hardware platforms, including Android and iOs. Additionally, the XDK  rendered the exact same code as a 'web app' or an 'enhanced' web app that performs exactly the same as a native app.    In December, 2011, Appmobi released its directCanvas technology as open source. directCanvas speeds HTML5 game screen rendering by as much as 18x, delivering ""native"" game performance to games written with HTML5. Also in December, ReadWrite named Appmobi as the ""Most Promising Company for 2012"".  March 12, 2012, Appmobi released version 1.0 of jqMobi, an open source,  jQuery-like JavaScript framework that is highly optimized for delivering an identical user experience on Android and iOS HTML5 mobile apps.  On Feb 21, 2013, Appmobi announced to its developers that all of its HTML5 development tools had been acquired by Intel, leaving appMobi as a ""pure play"" mobile cloud services provider. In late 2013, Appmobi joined Aspire Ventures and continued with a set of cloud services for SMEs. In January 2015, Appmobi pivoted and began development of an enterprise product - the Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform - which launched in early November 2015.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/1010573?trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A1010573%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1446818366835%2Ctas%3Aappmobi,,http://twitter.com/appmobi,https://www.facebook.com/Appmobi/?fref=ts,"54,818"

Other home security systems typically fall into two categories: cheap and ineffective or expensive and one-dimensional. Customers are fooled into thinking they are protected, but many burglars can actually defeat these cheap systems in under 30 seconds. And traditional alarm system companies charge thousands of dollars to put sensors on first floor windows and doors, and even more on bedroom windows and upstairs entry points. Most people simply can't afford what they really need. With LifeShield customers get better protection, reliability, and superior control compared to traditional analog-based security systems.  Plus, LifeShield was one of the first to provide remote access to your home security system. With LifeShield, you have always been able to log into your system from anywhere in the world for free. Some of the other systems are finally able to offer you this same type of access, but you'll pay for it. They'll add an extra cost to your monthly monitoring payments.  And with LifeShield you can access your system even more easily with apps for iPhone, Blackberry, and Android. Look for our iPod application launch coming in July.

Good passwords are hard to remember so users take short cuts to work around. With Authomate, credentials are stored on the smartphone – eliminating the human element from the authentication flow.  Authomate simplifies the user experience by allowing the user’s smartphone in proximity to an application, website, system, or device to seamlessly authenticate the user, while eliminating the need to enter user names, passwords and one-time codes or answering challenge questions – enabling companies to implement stronger, always on security and enforce policies, in each case, without complicating or frustrating their end users and customers. Key features include: enablement of multifactor authentication using contextually aware, dynamic factors; the ability to share access without sharing credentials; the ability to interface with VPNs and other non-web based applications that require credential input (including login for Macs and PCs); geofencing and geotagging; date and time restrictions; biometrics; defense against phishing sites; mitigating attack surfaces used to steal credentials; and robust logging of access.  Authomate allows enterprises to implement strong security policies that can be easily adopted by their users and customers, while eliminating the vulnerabilities of weak and reused passwords, forgotten passwords that lead to costly recovery processes, and password spreadsheets that may be shared between team members, and eliminates attack surfaces used to harvest credentials (e.g., malware, keyloggers, Man-in-the-Middle, Man-in-the-Browser, phishing and social engineering). Authomate’s solution is designed to fit within the enterprise’s existing security framework so it can be implemented in weeks, not months or years as required by other authentication solutions. While Authomate’s initial focus is on user authentication, the solution extends beyond access to applications and can be used for any transaction requiring credentials to be given to establish trust and access. The solution architecture reverses the credential flow, thereby eliminating the ability to compromise static devices like point of sale terminals, kiosks, ATMs, or websites for card not present, disabling the ability to use these avenues as an attack vector to steal credentials.

ROMAD's patented Malware Genetic Sequencing™ technology enables us to identify, analyze, and stop in real time entire viral ""families"", as opposed to specific strains or individual variants. This ability allows reliable, sustained detection and diffusion of a wide range of malware threats. We detect what OTHERS MISS – because we’re not stuck in the perpetual arms race with malware developers, passively looking for their next creation just to figure out how to catch it next time. We detect BEFORE others can – because we’re not waiting to analyze the new variant as a prerequisite to detection.  Derivative strains and variants are just that - derivative. Our patent-pending family-based detection profiles let us cover the vast majority of derivatives on-the-fly. We detect with the LEAST AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD, both on our team and on your endpoint – because unlike legacy platforms, we don’t need millions of individual static signatures to match the hundreds of thousands of derivative strains and variants created every day. We detect WHERE others cannot – our Malware Genetics™ and dynamic threat response technology allows ROMAD to sustain detection capability virtually in perpetuity. Isolated industrial deployment scenarios such as SCADA, ICS, and IoT environments where updates are infrequent, yet viral threats prevalent (think Stuxnet model), are a perfect place for ROMAD endpoint threat detection and response capabilities. We DISRUPT the criminal malware economic model by eliminating the critical time-to-detection gap – the opportunity to monetize the malware before detection is developed by legacy static-signature platforms. We eliminate the economic incentive for malware writers, kit builders, and bot herders, thereby contributing to the elimination of the vast majority of profit-driven malware presently in the wild. Legacy anti-virus companies, dominated by outdated thinking and outmoded malware detection methods, chase their tales as they keep growing their analyst teams and bloating their signature sets into the hundreds of millions. Then there’s ROMAD: an elegant, truly innovative, and uniquely capable platform specifically designed from the ground-up to address the actual root cause of the malware epidemic – the criminal malware economic model.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/romad-cyber/about/,,https://twitter.com/RomadCyber,,"77,286"
