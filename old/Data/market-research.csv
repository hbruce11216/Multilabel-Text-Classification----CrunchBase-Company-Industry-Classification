Stephenson following the death of his mother, Mary Brown Stephenson. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in the 1970s, Richard and his mother quickly began to research treatment opportunities. They sought alternative remedies and care options relating to diet, exercise and spirituality. Mary's choices were limited. Few institutions appeared to understand, let alone value, the vital connection between one's physical health and their psychological well being. Mary passed away in 1982. While mourning, the bereaved Richard promised to forever alter the course of cancer treatment in America. Stephenson graduated from Wabash College in 1962 and earned his J.D. degree from Northwestern University. While studying at Northwestern, Stephenson founded the International Capital Investment Company (ICIC). In 1975, a Zion, Illinois, hospital was sold to Capitol Investment Company, and soon after the sale, Richard assumed the role of Chairman of the Board. After his mother's passing, Richard started the process to develop the hospital into the nation's preeminent cancer treatment center.  The facility reopened in 1988 as the American International Hospital and became the first cancer treatment center to implement and apply the Mother Standard care model, a patient-centered approach designed to provide those afflicted with cancer the same level of care that a mother would give her child. The Mother Standard system provided patients with traditional oncology treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as alternative and emerging care options such as immunotherapy, hyperthermia, tumor biology and nutrition.These supportive therapies were designed to manage the side effects from intensive treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, and to enhance patients' quality of life.  Striving to enhance patients' quality of life, CTCA provided unorthodox care methods such as aromatherapy, detoxification, hydrotherapy, massage, naturopathy, acupuncture psycho-social intervention, spiritual support and even humor therapy. Set on empowering cancer patients and their loved ones with hope-fulfilling options for care, Stephenson declared, ""I never wanted to see another cancer patient suffer the agony of living without hope."" Constructed in 1958, the American International Hospital thrived throughout the 1980s, and CTCA opened their second hospital in 1990, the year prior, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as part of the city's City of Faith hospital.  In June 1991, the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board approved a certificate of need by a unanimous vote. The Zion City Council approved $20 million in bonds in September that year to finance the hospital's renovation, and the thirty-year-old facilities reopened, new and improved. In 1991, Richard founded the Gateway for Cancer Research and served Chairman. 99 cents of every dollar publicly donated goes to fund clinical trials. To date, the foundation has raised more than $75 million and funded over 140 cutting-edge clinical trials around the world. In keeping with CTCA's unorthodox but results-driven methods, December 1997 saw the establishment of the Cancer Resource Center. Gurnee Mills mall in Gurnee, Illinois became home to the center, a place Richard built to give all people the chance to learn and become educated via up-to-date articles and research materials. The center was located nearby CTCA's flagship hospital, renamed Midwestern Regional Medical Center.  As then-CEO of Midwestern Regional Medical Center Roger Cary explained the center's purpose to the Chicago Tribune in 1997, patients can find what they need ""in surroundings that are comfortable [...] instead of searching from place to place and in medical libraries"". CTCA closed out the 1990s with the opening of the Mary Brown Stephenson Radiation Oncology Center, built in Zion, near the American International Hospital. The new oncology center provided additional outpatient rooms and services and housed state-of-the-art radiation and rehabilitation technologies. In 2005, CTCA Tulsa opened a brand new, renovated hospital. The state-of-the-art facility became the only major hospital dedicated solely to cancer treatments in Oklahoma. CTCA Philadelphia opened their doors within the same year and began treating patients. CTCA opened their largest facility to date, at 210,000 square feet, in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008. The CTCA opened their latest center in 2012. As of 2018, CTCA Phoenix will begin delivering onsite chemotherapy and radiation oncology services at their Outpatient Care Center, located in North Phoenix. Cancer Treatment Centers of America's national network of fully accredited cancer hospitals have earned accreditation and certification from the Joint Commission, the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer, the QOPI Certification Program and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). CTCA is world renowned for their high-quality care and for consistently exceeding patient safety standards from numerous healthcare organizations, such as the Association of Community Cancer Centers and the American College of Radiology. CTCA hospitals in Chicago and Philadelphia have been recognized by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), a University of Nebraska Medical Center program. Four CTCA hospital locations have received awards from the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC) for their breast center treatment programs. CTCA's suburban Chicago location has earned Magnet Recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) for excellence in nursing. All CTCA locations are striving to earn this designation; only 9 percent of hospitals in the U.S. can boast ANCC's Magnet Recognition.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/20260,,http://twitter.com/CancerCenter,http://www.facebook.com/cancercenter,"127,467"

For vertical-industry applications, we define them in the similar vein - meaning that these applications are designed to perform any one of the five following functions - back-office, front-office, customer information management, operations and specialized capabilities like Picture Archiving Applications for healthcare providers. Other examples of vertical-industry applications include Fulfillment in Communications, Project Costing in construction, Catering in Leisure and Lodging, Claims Processing in insurance, Point-Of-Sale in retail, Smart Metering Infrastructure in utilities, and Student Information Systems in education.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/apps-run-the-world,,http://twitter.com/appsruntheworld,https://www.facebook.com/AppsRunTheWorld,"157,849"

Since 2009, Enterprise Technology Research (ETR) has been organically growing an end user member base that could accurately represent and therefore, accurately predict IT spending trends. The sample now exceeds 3,000 members globally. This sample mimics the S&P 500’s industry composite, but also includes members from the government, nonprofit and education sectors.  Furthermore, the sample is ~70% large enterprise and 65% North American based. ETR has now conducted 14 spending intention surveys in a standardized format methodology and has accurately forecast numerous occurrences of significant growth by formerly unknown technology vendors, as well as the demise of many other vendors that were once thought invincible.  It is our belief that our forward-looking data and analytics model can dramatically aid enterprise IT end users and CIOs to identify which of their vendors are most at-risk and therefore, most prone to price leveraging. In the ever-evolving enterprise technology landscape, ETR can also highlight vendors that deserve to be evaluated immediately.  Our surveys routinely capture a sample size of over 150 people within 24 hours and we routinely close surveys after 4-5 weeks with samples of over 400.

BioNimbus allows for the real time gathering and analysis of discrete data emanating from the human body in response to varied stimuli through sensors or mobile wearables. The BioNimbus technology can be applied to anything that can be sensed (e.g. sound, smell, a human interaction, etc.) and the test outcome can be appropriately designed. BioNimbus is a powerful economic disruptive force, delivering similar or better analysis to the customer faster and at costs of $300 CPI (Cost per Interview) rather than $500 to $800 CPI. Using political analysis as an example, the BioNimbus technology conducted a study in October of 2016 with faculty members of the Texas Tech the College of Media and Communications. The study investigated what genuinely causes the hard-to-move undecided voters in elections to “budge”. Budging is defined as the act of finally moving an implacable undecided definitively toward a specific candidate. The stimuli used were specific candidate inflections (eleven primary inflections). BioNimbus’ AI tools analyzed the impulse data inflections most strongly statistically correlated with “budging”. The results of the study were almost identical, in terms of voter percentage, to the national election results. The BioNimbus technology has already been applied to Consumer Packaging (“CPG”) projects. BioNimbus enables rapid testing of design concepts allowing companies to determine suitability and engagement by users and consumers at all stages of a product life cycle. It is a powerful risk management tool for a company providing insights at the stages (i.e. design, concept, prototype) when it is more economic to make product changes. A client has a great deal of control with BioNimbus with the ability to set up tests and receive analysis of data in a dashboard format. BioNimbus has applicability for a wide range of vertical markets. Aside from political analysis and CPG, other markets include education (i.e. engagement testing of content preparation), law enforcement and corrections (i.e. surveys and training of proper procedures) healthcare (i.e. labeling, protocol training) and government (i.e. armed forces training).  Technology development and initial product trials to date has been funded internally by Cascade Strategies. Cascade Strategies is moving ahead to roll out the applications of the BioNimbus technology establishing partnerships involving analytics and operations partners, market research companies (sample providers, research services) and Product Lifecycle Management companies (major established and emerging design companies).",https://www.linkedin.com/company/cascade-strategies-inc.,,https://www.twitter.com/cascadestrat,https://www.facebook.com/cascadestrategies,"344,407"

Speakalyze is a platform and set of tools that have the scalability of survey tools and some of the intimacy of focus groups and interviews. Speakalyze allows companies to ask a question of their customers or constituents who, using a convenient device (phone, Smart Speaker), reply by submitting short (3-5 minute) audio replies/recordings. These audio replies are then analyzed and accessible reports with actionable insights are generated using machine learning and Speaklyze’s proprietary software. Companies benefit in two ways: first, they receive actionable customer feedback that has the nuance, complexity, and authenticity of the spoken word, which is then analyzed and packaged in convenient formats. Second, companies can use the platform to enhance customer engagement by making customers feel ”heard” and “in their own voice”.

Storyleaders,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/storyleaders,http://storyleaders.com/home-page/,"Market Research, Marketing","Data and Analytics, Design, Sales and Marketing","Back in 2008, Storyleaders began as a journey to see what else was out there.","Back in 2008, Storyleaders began as a journey to see what else was out there, to try to demystify what the most influential salespeople and leaders were doing that was so much different than anyone else. We started to ask questions: Why is it that only a small % of salespeople are able to develop mutual trust and respect with customers? Why do only the very few get other people to open up to them? Why do only a few reach the high level of connection that fosters collaboration, the reciprocal sharing of ideas and beliefs that can move people to change and why haven’t we, in the sales training industry, been pursuing these questions more aggressively? It’s ironic: somewhere along the line, a profession whose prevailing model that is based on questions, stopped asking questions about itself. So we did it. We began challenging our own beliefs, starting with, “Is there a better way?” This led to more and more questions, a domino effect, and soon we found our- selves in fields of study that had been previously off limits to us—fields that explored the mysteries of communication that we’d written off as unteachable because they fell out- side the purview of our models and industry research. We had been training salespeople for a combined 40 years and we thought we had all the answers. For most of that time, our definition of selling has been some variation of “helping people solve problems.” The definition was based on the belief that the decision to “buy” is like problem solving, logical and rational. For our Solution Selling and CustomerCentric Selling methodologies, we taught salespeople to ask buyers a series of logic-oriented questions designed to lead the buyer to conclude the seller’s product was the logical, right answer. As it turns out, a lot of our basic assumptions were wrong. People are not logical and rational when making the decision to buy. Furthermore, asking buyers questions—at least the kinds of questions we were training salespeople to ask— is not an effective means of connection or persuasion. In fact, the way we conditioned salespeople to ask questions has proven to be often counterproductive. We missed the mark: we wildly misinterpreted what the most influential salespeople were actually doing. They weren’t just asking buyers questions; they were establishing emotional connections. They were inspiring other people to follow their beliefs. They were influencing people to change minds. They were doing things that weren’t being taught in sales training classes, and they weren’t doing the things we were teaching. This is an especially hard pill for us to swallow, because we’re the ones who created the solution selling training paradigms. What we soon learned was that we should have been looking for answers outside the sales productivity industry all along. People in other disciplines already understood a lot more about sales and influence than the sales training industry did. We’ve come out the other end of this journey with a profoundly new understanding of sales effectiveness: how people get other people to change minds. And we’re sharing this understanding in our Storyleaders™ workshops. These are for sales professionals and for anyone else—executives, politicians, teachers, attorneys, consultants, and so on—whose work involves influencing others, whether one is “selling” products, services, ideas, advice, or beliefs. By demystifying what great salespeople do, we believe we ourselves have learned to better influence change, develop deeper relationships with our customers, and find greater meaning in selling.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/storyleaders,,http://twitter.com/storyleaders,http://www.facebook.com/storyleaders,"489,140"

As a national indicator of the health of the U.S. economy and a tool for gauging the competitiveness of individual firms and predicting future profitability, it supports business, researchers, policymakers, and consumers of the U.S. It surveys roughly 70,000 customers each year to collect information with regards to the products and services that they use the most. Information collected through these surveys is used as inputs to an econometric model that scales customer satisfaction with more than 230 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors, as well as over 100 services, programs, and websites of federal government agencies. American Customer Satisfaction Index’s time-tested, scientific model delivers key insights across the complete customer experience. Its results are related to some essential indicators of micro and macroeconomic performance. At the micro level, companies that display high levels of customer satisfaction tend to have higher earnings and stock returns relative to competitors. At the macro level, customer satisfaction has been shown to be predictive of both consumer spending and gross domestic product growth. Starting in May 2010, American Customer Satisfaction Index data became available to the public on a more regular basis, with results released multiple times per year. This change allows stakeholders to focus more in-depth on different sections of the economy over the entire calendar year.  American Customer Satisfaction Index was founded in the United States in 1994 by researchers at the [University of Michigan](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-university-of-michigan-2), along with the American Society for Quality in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and CFI Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

These two men were at SRI and had a vision of creating a high tech research firm and originally wanted it to be part of SRI. At the time, SRI was not interested so they left to start Creative Strategies. The two worked together at CS until 1971 when David Norman decided to leave and start Dataquest. Larry Wells continued to grow Creative Strategies and in 1974, sold it to Business International, a global business consulting organization who wanted a high tech research arm to supplement their various consulting practices around the world. In those days, Creative Strategies was well known for their major reports about many technology issues. Their original focus was on the impact of mini-computers on next generation business practices as well as researching areas such as storage mediums, WW communications and international data traffic. An interesting factoid is that not long after Apple introduced the Apple II computer in 1978, a summer intern named Trip Hawkins wrote what became the first study about personal computers. At the time, Hawkins was at Stanford and worked at Creative Strategies during the school break. Interestingly, that report was read by a young Steve Jobs who challenged Trips assumptions. Hawkins asked to meet with Jobs and not long after that meeting, Jobs hired Trip to become the first director of market research at Apple. After Hawkins left Apple, he founded Electronic Arts and has been a pioneer in the PC industry for decades. In 1981, Creative Strategies current president and principal analyst, Tim Bajarin, joined the company and became their first full time PC analyst covering what was the birth of the PC industry. His original project was to work with the IBM PC team and with their staff he studied the trends in retail, business and consumer demand for personal computers. He was also a consultant on the original IBM laptop project that eventually became the ThinkPad brand of portable computers. During those early years, he also worked on projects for Compaq, HP, Apple, Adobe and Epson as well as Software Publishing and Lotus. Consequently, he was an eye witness to the birth of the PC industry. In 1984, Business International wanted to close down the San Jose office of Creative Strategies and move the staff back to NYC where their headquarters are located. The management team at the time, led by Ed Poshkus, did not want to make this move and instead offered to do a leveraged buyout so that the company could be independent and continue to cover the world of technology from Silicon Valley. Business International agreed to this plan and for the next 10 years the company continued to be a leader in traditional technology related market research. In 1994, the original partners who bought the company from Business International wanted to either retire or move on so Tim Bajarin took over the company and moved it from a mainstream market research facility to one that focuses more on high tech consulting and specialized tech research. Today, Mr. Bajarin and his team cover all aspects of the PC industry as well as the consumer electronics markets, serve on many industry advisory boards and provide various programs and services to many of the major companies in these industries.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/creative-strategies-inc/,,https://twitter.com/creativestrat,https://www.facebook.com/csiresearchsj/,"639,649"
