All participants in the Content Marketplace: Content Providers, Advertisers and Consumers have pains in the current system. Content Providers want to create enhanced engagement, know more about their viewers, deliver enhanced advertising and create simple, better Search Engine Optimization within their sites as well as in traditional Search Engines. Advertisers know there is an audience but they want to know the Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Products they are associated with fit all their marketing needs and do not create tensions. Consumers want a simple and easy experience that will also allow them to have a voice. Currently, there is too much unidentifiable or inappropriately labeled Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Product content on too many channels to properly make it all fit. Where and what is all this Big Data? 451 Degrees has created Graffiti, a Big Data software as a service (SaaS), that, without requiring any change to the original content, helps solve these issues and more. Graffiti follows content, whether it is an article, video, image, music or product, over multiple locations such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook plus others and analyzes all comments and info about that piece as an independent source and in symphony. Graffiti works with content publishers; news sites, video sites, image sites, product sites, blogs, e-commerce product sites and any one with comments or a desire to increase consumer engagement within their site. Big Data bringing Real Time results increasing revenues and relevance. Here’s how it works... Utilizing a simple bi-directional API, Graffiti analyzes large data sets so they can be used in a pro-active and revenue generating capacity to identify opportunities and strategies to better engage your consumer, deliver better advertising or product placement to your product and define all things properly. Graffiti is built to specifically analyze and redefine Internet content in REAL TIME by augmenting existing meta data with user generated comments. In short - Graffiti recognizes what is actually being said and its relevance by using patented Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) techniques. Most Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files or e-Commerce Products contain some original meta data placed on that content by the owners of that content. As a web based analytics tool and service, Graffiti will continually analyze these articles of content and update them with more relevant, truly organic, “meta tags” based on actual comments and what is really being talked about. These updates are automated in Real Time as new meta data. The content continues to evolve as the community Comments about it. This translates into the consumers ability to easily find the Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files and Products they seek. User commentary is better defined and assists the content owner with developing a true, instead of perceived or desired, set of tags originally placed by the content owner. What are the benefits to our Clients? Our core functionality allows our clients to analyze Big Data in Real Time, classify and redefine content by evaluating user comment based data generated through consumer engagement. This is no longer “junk” but the most useful element of any content. It is the audience of many brought into focus and use. The evaluation of Big Data, in the form of comments, in turn generates more true engagement which delivers stronger and more refined meta data to use when optimizing search (SEO) as well as Ad Delivery Networks (ADN) Key Word targets or Product Placement for every piece of content. Graffiti accomplishes this by collecting ALL comments available across the web and applying a proprietary algorithm to determine the most appropriate meta-tags and serving these refined meta-tags as a service in REAL TIME back to the original source. As well as to the Ad Delivery Network or Recommendation  Engine for increased transaction opportunity in Real Time. This Ad Delivery Network can exist as a stand alone Below The Fold (BTF) ADN thus creating and entire new frontier of revenue inside a barren wasteland. These are found revenues that are proven to be of the highest values in Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA) transactions. Who Can Use Graffiti? Graffiti works with businesses that wants to make deep learning sense of comments and other consumer commentary and use it for engagement and revenue generation practices. Our target clients are Content Owners, Media, Consumer Brands, BioTech, e-Commerce and multi-national Corporations as well as strategic partners with existing technology solutions where we can provide added value to their offering.

The mission of 1ON1 is to offer search engine optimization training to entrepreneurs, small business owners, marketing professionals, website designers, and other individuals who have a website in a format that can allow them to directly apply lessons to their own businesses and learn based on their own needs and at their own pace.   1ON1 SEO training course was designed by Bruce Jones, an SEO tutor and industry expert who realized that there existed two main flaws with SEO that were inhibiting results. First, traditional SEO services offer optimizing websites as part of a digital marketing strategy. While these can work wonderfully, the client must continue to pay for search engine optimization, or else it will overtime become ineffective, since the client does not know how to keep up with the strategy after the optimization package is no longer being paid for. Second, those individuals that are wise to seek out an SEO teacher are offered group classes where they are taught at a fast pace about general information and are not given the chance to apply teachings to their own website.   Ultimately, your best investment when it comes to SEO is knowledge and a functioning skillset which will allow you to become your own expert. That is why the best SEO training course is one that gives you individual classes and works on your own website with you, based on your goals and needs.   Online Courses with your own SEO teacher  Our service offers a comprehensive one on one SEO training with an expert SEO tutor, who uses a virtual classroom to teach individual lessons that cater to your skillset and needs.

Localize It,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/localize-it,http://www.localizeitnow.com,"Advertising, Information Technology, Local Business, Marketing, SEO","Advertising, Information Technology, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",Local internet marketing services,"Localize It is one of the most helpful local seo and informative local internet marketing services online.  Their primary goal is to take your growing business and make it stand out against the crowd. They are able to do this by adding your companyâ€™s information, website and anything else you desire to over 100 of the top search engines and directories. Their â€œexclusiveâ€ package is what we based our review on, since it focuses 100% on getting your business noticed on local business directories. This package offers all of the basics we looked for, and even a few extras, which is why we gave it our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award. Localize It takes something simple, like your company's basic contact information, and does everything in their power to get it noticed by thousands. Submission Features:   A good local business directory service will be able to take all the information you send them and get it online and noticed within just a few days. Localize It submits all your company's information to each local business directory site manually, which helps build your credibility. A computer program inputs your information when there are simple updates to your address, phone number or other minor information.  Localize It will work on getting your business noticed on hundreds of different local business directories. This means that your chance of being found through search engines, directories, blogs and a variety of others sources is dramatically increased. Your information is added once manually and then updated on a monthly basis to ensure that your companyâ€™s information is current and up to date. Localize is states that your business will be found on 85% of all web searches.  Directories:   Localize It submits your businesses information to a wide variety of well-known directories. The most common directories include sites like Google Maps, Yellow Pages, Yelp, MapQuest and hundreds more. One thing that makes this local business directory different from the others is its dedication to making sure that all of the company information is SEO-friendly and link-friendly. This makes getting traffic from these high-end search engines even easier because the content is right the first time. Localize It has a team of local business directory experts that know which sites will accept your business and which will produce the best results.  We were very pleased to see that all of the directories other than movie spots were included on their list. Covering all avenues of traffic ensures that people using phones, GPS systems or even online Yellow Pages will find your company. You will notice an immediate boost in the amount of traffic to your business after just a few short weeks. This is due to the fact that content-rich information is distributed to every possible local business directory. Business listings are becoming extremely important since directories like Bing and Google Places are able to track down where people are searching from and give them accurate directions. If someone is in your area but your business doesnâ€™t show up on mobile directories, there is a good chance you've lost a possible customer. Since this service uploads to mobile directories, GPS systems and even social networks, your business has a much better chance of being found on most search results. Overall, this local business directory is able to not only provide hundreds of top-level directories for business submission, but it also produces results almost immediately. Localize It is a trusted partner of large data carriers which allows them to feed your information directly into these databases. This is ideal since all of the databases are trusted sources by the major publishers on the web. Your listings will show up on hundreds of other sites through this trusted sharing. Therefore, in the end your business shows up on well over a hundred local business directories with very little effort. Reports/Tools:   Localize It has the best reporting tools we have seen on any local business directory site. From the first time you submit your information, you will know what kind of traffic is coming your way. As soon as all your information is posted on the 100+ directories, you will receive a submission summary. You will also receive a â€œMy Reputation Manager Scoreâ€ which gives you a score based on the saturation and depth of directory listings. You may notice that the first reported number is a little lower, but in time this will grow as your company becomes more recognized.  Along with your submission summary, you will also notice two main steps that will help improve your score over the next few months. The first step is what the Localize It is doing to further improve your score. The second step is the one you will need to pay close attention to. Generally the suggestions in this section will include things you can do within your own business to improve reviews and ratings. Your reports will also provide information on search engines and local search sites, detail what was added to each, report on ratings and reviews and show paid placements, if any. This detailed information allows you to update your employees on the progress. Overall, we were extremely pleased with the amount of detail and help this local business directory provides its customers.  Help/Support:   Localize It has the quickest response time out of any local business directory service we reviewed. Their support features include email, phone number, online information, FAQs and chat support. We found that the easiest method to get detailed information is through a simple email. Response times are within 24 hours, which is very fast, and they supply a plethora of information. Live chat and the FAQs page are also excellent ways to get answers to common questions. Summary:  Localize It offers everything you need to be noticed on the majority of local business directories. Their extensive reports and helpful tips will allow you to expand your business and drive more people to your company. Your information is submitted to all of the highest trafficked and top directories to ensure that your company is noticed whenever someone searches for your kind of business. We were extremely pleased with the support from this company and feel that they are capable of answering any question you may have. This is one of the best local business directory services for any size business.",,,http://twitter.com/localsearchco,,"426,152"

The service also helps promote each post through popular social channels. Hi, I'm Chris Hornak founder of Blog Hands. I've been a digital marketing expert for over a decade and I started Blog Hands as a result of a simple observation: Blogging is an essential strategy to virtually any digital marketing campaign, yet developing content on a consistent basis is a real chore, and many marketing managers are busy overlooking the many aspects of their campaigns.  During my time managing digital marketing campaigns I found hiring in-house, though typically lead to better content, was very time intensive and hard to scale. When it came to outsourcing, though it was much easier to scale, I was rarely happy with the work that was being delivered. Worst of all the contacts that I was working with had little to no digital marketing background... so they couldn't speak my language. Blog Hands was designed to provide you with the quality of work of an in-house writer at the cost and flexibility of outsourcing.

The basis of any online campaign, analytics provides the ability to benchmark and test the effectiveness of all strategies. The first thing Chicago Style SEO does with any client is set up Google Analytics or review existing set ups. We set up advanced data filters that allow us to weed out the irrelevant information and segment the rest. We recommend letting the new setup collect at least 1-2 weeks worth of data to provide a good benchmark for the initiatives to come. During the initial benchmarking phase, Chicago Style SEO will do extensive research to find appropriate keywords for your website and business. We highly recommend starting out with a full Google Adwords campaign to test which keywords convert to customers and test the ad copy that resonates and gets click throughs. While the paid placement campaign runs, Chicago Style SEO will give your website a thorough review and report with recommended changes and improvements. During this period, we also take an in depth look at your main competition to determine strengths and weaknesses (to emulate and exploit, respectively). Finally, we will provide comprehensive link building assessment that becomes the road map for new initiatives. Once the pay-per-click campaign has gathered enough data, we can make a strong determination of the keywords that we will focus on for organic search engine optimization. At this point, we fine tune your website with these keyword phrases in mind and begin the link building campaign. A truly comprehensive approach to SEO includes measures to monitor and protect your brand and keep existing customers happy. Chicago Style SEO will help you connect with customers and prospects on the major social media outlets. We will show you how to use user-generated content to create preemptive listings to protect your brand name. Keeping an ear to the web, we will monitor conversations about your company to give you our expert insite on how to take advantage of positive situations and diffuse negatives before they get out of hand.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/chicago-style-seo,,http://twitter.com/chicagostyleseo,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chicago-Style-SEO/47330435896,"466,608"
