ITSCAPE,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/itscape,http://www.itscape.com,"App Discovery, SaaS, Software","Apps, Sales and Marketing, Software",Cloud-based IT Systems Management,"ITSCAPE provides a new generation of low-cost, high-quality, easy-to-use cloud-based system management products. Companies are losing $26.5B every year due to outages and unplanned downtime. A major contributor to these outages is the difficulty managing the rapidly increasing complexity of IT environments created by virtualization and cloud technologies. Business applications and processes are more complex to manage as they are no longer contained to a few servers in a datacenter, but spread out across many physical and virtual servers inside and outside a company. This creates a lack of visibility of where applications reside and what servers or components they are dependent on. IT managers often have no idea of which servers, databases, connection, and more support their companies business-critical services. Simple changes to a single server can cause major outages.  ITSCAPE provides a new, cloud-based, affordable, and easy way to perform application discovery, application dependency mapping map, and change tracking in an IT environment –including elements that are physical, virtual, or in the cloud.  With ITSCAPE, IT managers get an accurate and comprehensive understanding of all of the servers, applications, databases, and communications in their datacenter, see the relationships between these IT components, and get clear visibility into the IT systems that support their company’s business critical services.  This information can then be used to pinpoint or prevent issues that cause performance problems, outages and downtime.  ITSCAPE helps IT managers more quickly resolve service issues, keep an accurate view of ""who changed what when."" ITSCAPE can also be used to prepare to optimize IT systems or for datacenter transformation initiatives such as  virtualization, consolidation, and/or migration.  Traditional auto-discovery and dependency mapping solutions are expensive to purchase, install, and maintain. ITSCAPE is changing this.  ITSCAPE requires no hardware, expensive training classes, or consulting services and is priced to be affordable for small to medium sized businesses.  Next, ITSCAPE can be set up and functioning in minutes, is self-maintaining, requires no upgrades, and has little to no impact on existing IT systems. Finally, it can provide initial discovery and dependency mapping results in an hour or less and is easy-to-use and understand by both technical and non-technical staff.",,,http://twitter.com/IT_scape,

It’s for these reasons that over half of all Americans agree that social media is a negative influence on the world. Businesses’ (especially SMBs) only way of knowing when and why people are interested in their products is reactively, once they have been exposed to their advertising. These companies are losing out on a completely untapped area of business-to-customer communication where, preemptively, companies are able to generate revenue from customers who have never interacted with their advertising in any way.  Solution: WhoYou allows users to have complete control over their social media experience because, for the user, YOU are the master of the content that you see, hear, and feel. You are able to pull out the information from other users that you’re interested in, freeing you from the incessant negativity that is now available. For businesses, user’s cynical insinuations caused by your advertising will disappear, as you will be able to communicate in a real, unobtrusive human manner with those people most interested in the products and services that you provide, in a completely preemptive manner. This is a completely new way to connect and it’s not just exciting because it’s different, it’s exciting because it’s better. WhoYou Mission Statement: We are a tool for connecting like-minded users, creating human understanding from a technology application. We seek to eliminate unwanted peer-to-peer interactions by enabling positivity and good-natured conversations for all users and aim to divest humanity from the cynicism and hate that is pervasive on social media. All social media today is push-oriented meaning users push their opinions, politics, humor and more onto each other. WhoYou is the first ever pull-oriented connection application. Users pull the information out from one another that they are interested in, enabling positive, value-added interactions. WhoYou is the ultimate combination between a search engine and a social media platform. No other company provides this same service! How it Works: A user sets their geographic area and searches for a word or phrase. They can also add connotation to their search to give it specificity. If another user in their area is searching for the same word or phrase, their profile will appear (a little bio, pictures, other searches). The original user can take a look and then send them a message. The receiver can preview the message before they accept it. If they do accept the message, a conversation can begin.  Here’s a quick example; you set your area for 10 miles and search for “Angel Investor”. You can add specificity to your search by adding “Let’s talk about…” Anyone else searching for “Angel Investor” within 10 miles will appear. You can then look at their profile and if you like what you see, you can send them a message. If they accept, you can start chatting!",https://www.linkedin.com/company/whoyouapp/,,https://twitter.com/WhoYouApp,https://www.facebook.com/whoyouapp
