The company simplifies the manual application process to one that is 100% online and automated. Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000. Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a business’s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle. The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses – online and brick-and-mortar – in February 2014. In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones. Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available. Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazine’s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbage’s data and technology platform available through MasterCard’s network of acquirers. In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list. In October 2015, Kabbage completed a Series E funding round of $135 million led by Reverence Capital Partners. Holland’s ING, Spain’s Santander (via InnoVentures, Santander's venture capital arm); and Canada’s Scotiabank also participated in the round. Kabbage also announced a strategic partnership with ING to deliver instant capital to small businesses throughout Spain. In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transaction’s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbage’s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015. In 2017, the company raised $250 million from Softbank Group Corp., raising its total equity funding to $500 million, making Kabbage one of the most well-funded companies with a female co-founder at the helm. It also secured the largest asset-backed securitizations of small business loans in the online lending industry of $525 million. In November, it diversified its debt-funding sources further with a $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse, earning investment-grade ratings of ‘A’ and ‘BBB’ by DBRS. It ranked on the Inc. 500 list as one of the country’s fasting-growing private companies for a third consecutive year, on Deloitte’s Fast 500 list, among CB Insights Fintech 250, in the top 10 of KPMG’s Fiintech 100, and its co-founder, Kathryn Petralia, was named one of Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World.

In partnership with energy utilities and certified contractors, we solve the problems that make houses too hot, too cold, and too wasteful. Upgrades like HVAC, insulation, air sealing, and smart home technology keep your house working and feeling great in any weather. We coordinate projects from beginning to end, and we stand behind our work. If we don’t reduce your home’s energy use, we don’t get paid. Mission: Sealed is on a mission to unlock comfort, value, and efficiency hidden in peoples' homes.  We offer smart home retrofits and turnkey project management to make upgrading your house a snap. Through our innovative performance payment program, we cover the upfront costs of the installations. Homeowners then pay Sealed using the energy they save. We believe in standing behind our work: if Sealed customers don't save energy, we don't get paid. Over 50% of single-family homeowners have significant comfort or other problems (health, safety, etc.) that could be solved with energy-saving upgrades (insulation, new boiler, smart thermostat, etc.). Most homeowners would prefer to pay for these upgrades with their energy savings rather than pay cash or take out a loan. But historically, banks have not been willing to lend money based on residential energy savings unless they feel confident in the underlying analytics. Sealed’s HomeAdvance financing program provides capital to cover the upfront costs of energy-saving upgrades. After the upgrades are installed, customers pay Sealed based on the amount of energy they save, guaranteed. Sealed’s proprietary data, analytics, and software enable investment-grade energy savings predictions. Sealed’s IP has enabled the first debt facility backed by residential energy savings cashflows (New York Green Bank) and the first residential energy savings insurance policy (Munich Re). Sealed reaches customers via local dealers (contractors), utilities, and digital marketing. Sealed recruits, trains, and manages dealers, helping them sell more projects with the Sealed HomeAdvance program.

In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time.  GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.  GrainChain changes this.  GrainChain utilizes the well-known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions.  The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system. This shortens a process that can currently take weeks down to a nearly instantaneous one. GrainChain benefits farmers, buyers, brokers, storage facilities, banks, suppliers of agricultural goods, governments, and ultimately every food consumer on earth; everyone that benefits from a more honest and efficient agricultural indust GrainChain was first introduced in 2013 by an inventor and entrepreneur Luis Macias.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/grainchainio/,,https://twitter.com/grainchainio,https://www.facebook.com/GrainChainIO/,"19,814"

We estimate that over 200 million meetings take place every year between the three sides of the capital markets (investors/c-suite and IR officers/sell side). Decades of survey data and commission flow data confirm that these meetings are the most valuable interaction for all capital markets participants. The problem before WeConvene was that all meetings were organised and executed using old technology or no technology at all - essentially a 1980's travel agency experience (including fax machines). Due to changes in regulation, market structure and investment styles the economics of investor access have changed. The investor access market has been democratized and this has created the demand for a technology based replacement for the manual workflows that until now dominated these interactions.  WeConvene was born out of first hand experience and frustration with the manual investor access workflows. WeConvene is a global SaaS platform that connects all three sides of the capital markets. Our platform is available to Corporates, investment banks, IR firms, brokers, independent research providers and professional investors/Asset managers. Specifically our workflow solution enables our clients to create, manage, promote, execute, discover and analyze any kind of meeting interaction with other capital markets constituents. We deliver an 'OpenTable' like experience to all capital markets participants. As an open platform there are zero barriers to engagement and anyone invited to an investor meeting can book themselves in without creating an account.  WeConvene is partnered with Bloomberg meaning that investor access events are accessible through the terminal as well as WeConvene.  As at December 2018 WeConvene has: a) 450 investor meeting hosts; b) 1,000 corporates directly and indirectly (via IR firms) using WeConvene; c) 150,000 professional investors in its ecosystem; and d) 2,000 investor events promoted each month.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/weconvene,,https://www.twitter.com/we_convene,,"22,977"
