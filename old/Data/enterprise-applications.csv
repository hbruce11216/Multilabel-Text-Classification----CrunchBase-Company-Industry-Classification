Over the years, ICV has grown to become a recognized leader in live event video production and webcasting. Corporate and commercial video production and video studio rentals to the San Francisco Bay Area and the Silicon Valley media market rounds out ICV's services.  ICV remains focused on providing personalized attention to every client and their projects. And thanks to the talented people that have become the ICV family, it's worked out great. In 1999 we designed and built our Studio and moved out of our small rented space. The Pleasanton facility was designed to be an open and spacious 8500 sq. ft office / studio with open offices, lots of creative space and something most video production companies do NOT have ""in-house""; our own 2500 sq. ft. video production studio sound stage. Our full Cyc walls and Lighting Grid make green screen compositing easy. San Francisco video production companies, and San Jose video producers use our video studio for their productions. When they're shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles video production companies, advertising agencies and producers use our video studio, audio booth, High Definition HK3800 video cameras, our HD-SDI Mobile video flypacks, edit on one of our 3 Final Cut/Premier Pro editing suites or utilize our creative web design / writing / graphics / production crew and staff to complete their projects. Using their proprietary live webcasting platform, V3, ICV provides not only the video production for any size event, but also provides a custom branded event or company media portal using any web address, with secure, responsive video players with chat, Q and A and synchronized slides along with full HD video streaming. Using V3 ICV can build and launch an integrated media portal in minutes and be streaming live on location anywhere immediately.  Content hosting, all A/V and video staff and gear and of course the video streaming using a global CDN is all managed by ICV. No customer staff or resources are required. Corporate staff can quickly learn how to build and deploy event or company meeting webcast portals themselves within V3. Once the media portal for the webcast has been published, a request is sent for ICV to staff the event and manage the complete video production.  Tools for management of live events and conferences covers user registration and management, speaker bios and photos, customizable agendas and session descriptions. The V3 platform provides monetization tools such as display advertising, and e-commerce sales supporting all major payment gateways to sell attendance of  both live webcast events or to view on-demand archives of content at a single URL, within a web site that the client can control.  Producers that wish to sell webcasting can white label V3 and deploy and manage the webcasts themselves within V32 in their own separate company portal where they can manage multiple customer webcast profiles while utilizing ICV's video production and webcast encoding services to resell webcast production. Since the beginning, we’ve used state-of-the-art technology and innovative design concepts to create compelling videos, effective web content and exciting digital media. Our ability to go anywhere in the world on a moments notice and produce webcast events and web portals with 100% confidence has gained us the trust of our clients. Because we refuse to be pushed into a niche, ICV has evolved into a unique full-service interactive media studio offering video production, webcasting and web development. We use all of those skills to help our clients market and develop their online strategies. From our company built and owned interactive media studio in Pleasanton, CA we serve the San Francisco Bay Area, San Jose, Silicon Valley and beyond.

The Joget platform started as the open source Joget Workflow project on SourceForge in 2009.

With almost 200,000 open source downloads and more than 10,000 community members since inception, the latest major release Joget Workflow v6 was introduced in 2018 with focus on modern User Experience (UX), and App Maintainability and Performance. Joget naturally transformed into a no-code/low-code rapid application development platform with process automation capabilities and strong integration capabilities embedded to accelerate development. Joget offers full-fledged agile application development capabilities (consisting of processes, forms, lists, CRUD and UI), including EAI/orchestration/integration or the task-based interface for traditional workflow/BPM products.

Through our years of experience working directly with frontline therapists, parents, support staff, and other business managers we realized the full impact that the treatments provided by BCBAs, RBTs, SLPs, OTs, PTs, LMFCs, and others had on the quality of families lives.  Families would express their appreciation to the therapists and even us on the business side when we had the chance to talk with them and that encouraged us to push farther forward the care opportunities our companies could provide. While we looked for additional ways to make the business of autism treatment more accessible and efficient in order to increase the patient base and available hours to work with patients we encountered a frustratingly low level of technological support and tools available to properly analyze the treatments and operations of the organizations.  knowing that this was our area of expertise that we could provide solutions for we left the care delivery business and founded Sidis Health in order to build the exact answer to all of the pain points we knew we and most other growing autism service companies were and would face utilizing all of today’s latest technologies. Sidis Health approached autism software from a unique perspective bred from the decades of experience held by its founders and developers in not just the autism/healthcare industry but in other large scale industries such as manufacturing, technology hardware/software, logistics, and retail/wholesale.  By drawing on these years of various industry experiences and solutions that worked for huge multi-billion dollar international conglomerates we took the best-practices around each individual aspect of autism service delivery and brought a fresh solution to market that could handle a single autism clinic or an organization with thousands of clinics using the same platform. Our platform and implementation process surfaces the unique culture and structure of each organization while customizing the specific workflows to work with each unique entity in a standardized way.  This creates the well-defined processes that are essential to an efficient and successful organization that can easily scale from a small company to a large enterprise while maintaining consistency in its service quality and optimally run lean on support staff.  Technology allows us to take advantage of automation for tasks such as billing while artificial intelligence and machine learning constantly analyze the mix of input/output variables to optimize scheduling and even enhance a therapist’s ability to adapt treatment plans and outcomes. Kids and families today suffering the effects of autism spectrum disorder deserve the best care, treatment, and support available.  Sidis Health delivers the foundation upon which any autism service organization can feel assured that they have the best technology solution and platform available to support the patients that they serve in a way that can infinitely scale so they can offer more, better services to more kids.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/critical-mass-technologies-inc/,,https://twitter.com/CMT_apps,https://www.facebook.com/Sidis-Health-108051530635760/
