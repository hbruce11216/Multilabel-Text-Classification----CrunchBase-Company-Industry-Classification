We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character.

Door combines the same principals and culture across residential real estate brokerage, mortgage and title - a team-centric commitment to client service through specialization, full-time non-commissioned experts, and a belief that technology can support and improve the experience and outcomes in home ownership. Our agents and loan officers spend 100% of their time working with clients rather than lead generation. We believe the traditional 100% commission, contractor model does not align with client interests. Our success in delivering the best outcomes in real estate can be independently measured by our Zillow rating of 4.9 out of 5.0.  The Door Difference: Technology as service enabler: We build technology to increase access, transparency and insights for clients in their  real estate journey.  Specialization : The real estate process requires a very wide range of skills, and the only way to manage each component of the process well is to specialize. Door agents & experts specialize in areas like project management,  marketing, lead management, home valuation, transaction coordination and negotiation to ensure each agent is focused on what they do best. This leads to happier agents and much better outcomes for clients. Keep More of their Home Equity : Since our agents focus only on client service (instead of lead generation), they are able to close many more transactions per month than a traditional agent - and with very high client satisfaction scores. That enables Door to charge far less in fees, and for our clients to keep more of their hard-earned equity.

With a focus on creating unique furniture showcasing international flavor, functional design, and sustainable materials, Arhaus furniture brightens any room with inspired decor. Arhaus designers search the world looking for eclectic designs and pieces to share with clients and customers at Arhaus locations, bringing back vivid furniture from master artisans. Arhaus was founded in 1986 by Jack Reed and his son John. The first store opened in downtown Cleveland as part of the Flats district in a building from the 1840s; thirty years later Arhaus now has locations in over 25 states. The store’s name was inspired by the Danish city Aarhus; after seeing the name, John Reed found a variation that conveyed an international feeling, combining his original inspiration with the German word for house. Jack Reed had a vision of a company that would sell unique products sourced from all over the world. Arhaus has partnered with vendors for over twenty years to ensure quality and consistency; vendors become more than just business partners, they become friends and family as both businesses expand. CEO John Reed says, “as we grow, they grow.” Arhaus works with vendors across the world to find handcrafted one-of-a-kind products. Amish-Americans in Ohio dry wood for years to create the Live Edge collection; iron artisans in Mexico forge iron frames for bar stools by hand. Arhaus buys directly from manufacturers who share the Arhaus vision for quality, design, and sustainability. Since the beginning of the company Arhaus has been committed to sustainability, and today Arhaus demonstrates those values through a philanthropic partnership with American Forests. Arhaus has never used wood from endangered forests in their furniture–all of the wood used today is sustainably sourced or recycled. Almost half of the raw materials used to create Arhaus products are recycled, including glass, metal, and wood. Arhaus is also passionate about using organic fibers and materials in furniture, creating high quality pieces you can feel good about.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/arhaus-furniture,,https://twitter.com/arhaus,https://www.facebook.com/Arhaus,"17,260"

Typically, landlord portfolios experience between 5%-10% vacancy loss on rentals. Yet, perfectly good applicants are regularly declined due to blemished credit, student status, or other factors that do not impact their ability to pay. That’s where Leap helps. Our proprietary underwriting tools allow for quick and thorough vetting of potential residents which expands a landlord’s pool of qualified tenants and eliminates default risk.  There is no cost to the landlord as the one-time, upfront fee is paid by the resident and secures rental income for the entire term of the lease. Further, Leap accepts applications from tenants before they begin their apartment search, pre-approving them up to a certain monthly rent amount and delivering qualified residents directly to landlords.  Our goal is to improve the financial performance of landlords while helping people qualify for better apartments.   Our application takes 4 minutes to complete and can be submitted on a phone, tablet, or computer, and approvals take just 30 minutes during business hours. Furthermore, Leap can pre-approve renters for a maximum monthly rental amount for free. That way if you haven’t found an apartment yet, it’s easier to know what to look for. With Leap, renters can get the apartment they want, not just the one landlords say they qualify for. No apartment is out of reach, and that is a guarantee. Visit us at www.leapeasy.com to see how easy it is to get the apartment of your dreams!",https://www.linkedin.com/company/leap-insurance-agency-llc/,,https://twitter.com/LeapEasy,https://www.facebook.com/leapeasy/,"24,851"

We developed a technology we call Certified Reality(tm) which authenticates the time and place of each video and prevents tampering.  Our solution is as simple as it is foolproof: tethered content.  Our first application is yaza, a map-based video storytelling app that realtors use to record immersive home and neighborhood tours.  The authenticity of these narrated tours builds trust with remote buyers and helps realtors sell more homes.  It is a realtor-centric market network that combines the viral nature of social messaging with a marketplace that becomes defensible at scale due to network effects.   Trends in e-commerce point to the rise of social selling and market networks, where trusted friends or influencers guide purchases rather than star ratings by strangers. The real estate market invented social selling, with Realtors being the original influencers.  Yet, ironically, most proptech business models count on cutting realtors out. Yaza is different. We put realtors front and center, a unique approach that is winning praise from customers and industry press alike.  ( www.yaza.io/press ) Beyond the experience of our team, our secret sauce is the aforementioned Certified Reality. It has enabled new use cases around remote property management and allows us to reach international buyers and properties, currently untapped by existing proptech leaders.

This qualitative, “feet on the street,” lifestyle information is usually more important than the property itself, and has traditionally only been available by word-of-mouth.  Unfortunately, all too often, you don’t find out until you’re already moved in, and it’s too late. We are an online community for connecting Homebuyers with neighborhood information beyond just stats and figures. Here, you can find the answers to questions like: How hard is it to get into a good school? Is it safe to play in the parks? Are there any good health food stores nearby? Is there a neighborhood recreation center? What is that new development down the street, and how will it impact my property value? Answers and information is provided by other members of the community, including residents and real estate professionals, who have lived and worked in the neighborhood - often times, for decades. Another challenge we’re committed to overcoming is that of selecting the right real estate professional who will advocate for you and hold your hand through the biggest purchasing decision of your life. Too many people select an agent from a flier, bus stop billboard, or shopping cart ad. Then you’re swept up and pressured into a relationship with someone you don’t necessarily gel with. What if you had the opportunity to get to know agents before deciding who to give commission to? WikiRealty allows you to explore expert insight, ask and answer questions, develop a relationship via direct messaging and text messages, and see what other professionals the agent has in their network who can help complete the process - from inspection, through title insurance, local landscapers, possible legal referrals, and potential construction contacts. Your kids will go to school and play in this neighborhood. The people here will be your neighbors for years to come. They say you don’t choose your family, but you can choose where you live and how your kids will grow up. At WikiRealty, we provide you the chance to meet and get to know your potential future friends and neighbors before even moving in.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/wikirealty,,http://twitter.com/wikirealty,http://www.facebook.com/WikiRealty,"61,051"

REIT,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reit,http://www.reit.com,"Financial Services, Non Profit, Real Estate","Financial Services, Other, Real Estate","REIT, or Real Estate Investment Trust, is a company that owns and also finances income-producing real estate.","Over nearly half a century, the U.S. real estate investment trust (REIT) industry has become an important segment of the U.S. economy and investment markets. U.S. REITs have seen their equity market capitalization soar from $90 billion to roughly $200 billion in just the past 10 years. In the process, that growth has set the stage for the adoption of the REIT approach to securitized real estate investment across the globe. Congress created REITs in the U.S. in 1960 as a way to make investment in large-scale, income-producing real estate accessible to all investors in the same way they typically invest otherwise â€“ through the purchase and sale of liquid securities. Prior to the creation of listed real estate equities, access to the investment returns of commercial real estate equity as a core asset was available only to institutions and wealthy individuals having the financial wherewithal to undertake direct real estate investment. In its early years, the industry was dominated by mortgage REITs, which provide debt financing for commercial or residential properties through their investments in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. The marketâ€:tm:s interest in equity REITs, which today usually both own and manage commercial properties, initially was limited because the ownership and management of assets were required to remain separate. That restriction changed with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which permitted REITs to both own and manage their properties as vertically integrated companies and helped set the stage for a secular wave of equity REIT IPOs in the mid-1990s. Currently, 83 percent of the 134 publicly traded U.S. REITs are equity REITs that own and most often manage commercial real estate and derive most of their revenue and income from rents. In aggregate, these companies own properties across all major property sectors and all major geographic regions. In order for a company to qualify as a REIT in the U.S., it must comply with certain ground rules specified in the Internal Revenue Code. These include: investing at least 75 percent of total assets in real estate; deriving at least 75 percent of gross income as rents from real property or interest from mortgages on real property; and distributing annually at least 90 percent of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.",,,http://twitter.com/REITs_NAREIT,http://www.facebook.com/REITsNAREIT,"63,548"

Our shelter communities are useful now as hunting, vacation, bed and breakfast, and resort sites:  “Fortitude Ranch: Prepare for the worst, enjoy the present.” This offers far more value to customers and more sales and profit for the business.  We have one location in West Virginia and a small recreation only site in Colorado that will be replaced by a full size Fortitude Ranch (FR) location.  With this small capital raise we will open up FR locations in CO and WI, purchase land for additional locations in NV and TX, and identify land and contractors for a total of 12 FR locations.  We will operate a few locations while waiting for the “Event”—a major media episode or disaster that spurs a jump in awareness of collapse threats and need for survival community protection. When this occurs we will immediately allow only higher margin long term memberships and quickly sell out the 12 FR locations and reap a huge return on investment.  We are an “Antifragile” investment since this capital raise goes primarily to land purchase and low cost buildings, which will likely appreciate in value.
