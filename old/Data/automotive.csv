""For me, it was probably the same feeling an artist gets the first time they pick up a paintbrush and put a mark on canvas,"" said Mikah. ""I could - for the first time ever - express so many creative mechanical ideas at the level of detail required to turn them in to reality."" With a professional background in Manufacturing Engineering and Enterprise Software Development, and as an avid autocrosser and Road Racer, it didn't take Mikah long to find parts that needed to be designed to make cars go faster. And so, what started as entertainment quickly grew into a business. That business has since then evolved into the All Angles Design of today serving clients ranging from ""one-man bands"" to MOPAR. We understand how companies of different sizes function and how needs vary by industry, specialty, market, etc. We have also identified several key areas of related services to complement our Design Services so that we can offer, for many clients, a single point of accountability that turns their need or idea into revenue from their customers with AAD handling everything in between.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/all-angles-design,,,http://www.facebook.com/AllAnglesDesign

The corporation was formed in 1920 in the consolidation of several chemical manufacturers. By 1928, Allied became the leading producer of ammonia in the world with the opening of its plant near Hopewell, Virginia. Post World War II, Allied continued to venture into new markets with the production of nylon 6 (used in manufacturing items from tires to clothing) and refrigerants. In 1958, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation moved its headquarters to Morristown, New Jersey where it was renamed Allied Chemical Corporation. In the 1940s these companies were transformed into divisions of Allied Chemical. There were further reorganizations and acquisitions of companies and plants during the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, and Allied became a conglomerate. Taking the name Allied Corporation in 1981, the firm acquired the Bendix Corporation, a manufacturer of automotive and aerospace equipment, in 1983.  Known as Allied-Signal in 1985, Allied expanded its aerospace, automotive, and engineered materials businesses through its merger with the Signal Companies. In 1993 the hyphen was dropped from the company’s name to convey a one-company image. In 1986 Allied-Signal spun off about 35 of its diverse subsidiary operations into a new and separate company so that the parent corporation, renamed AlliedSignal in 1993, could concentrate on its growing aerospace electronics and automotive operations.  In 1999, AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell—an international controls company that developed and supplied advanced technology products, systems, and services to aviation and space companies and industry—and adopted its name which it considered to be more recognizable. This merger was valued at $15 billion.  Today, with headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey and over 122,000 employees worldwide, Honeywell is organized into four major business units: aerospace, automation and control solutions, transportation systems, and specialty materials.",,,,

All you need to do is ask the right questions of us and we will bare ourselves to your scrutiny! We care, but not about making a profit like every other car leasing agency ever. We care about you. Our customers are at the top of our list, and we are truly delighted to be of service to you. As a part of this astounding service, we are proud to offer you a choice of Audi vehicles that would stun the manufacturers themselves! We believe in providing you with as much choice as you want. This is a common mistake that other car leasing companies make in the provision of their services. They make the wrong assumption: that just because one model of Audi is popular right now, everyone is going to want it. There needs to be a different mindset than this, like the one we have in our auto leasing company. We believe in the individuality of our customers, as well as their right to assert this. In keeping with this, we offer a range of vehicles from Audi to suit everyone’s needs, no matter how far out or diverse they are. Whether you are in the mood for a luxury sedan for the family or an executive car, we have what you need. All you need to do is get on your laptop or computer, or even your mobile phone. Log on to your browser and find our site. Give our range a spin and have a ton of fun picking your new dream car! If you have the good luck of living in Staten Island, you can enjoy an added perk of leasing an Audi with us. When you order the vehicle, we deliver it to your doorstep completely free of charge. You need not lift a finger, other than to sign the lease agreement we bring to you. No hassle, no big city cabs, none of the risks for double the benefits. Could it get any better than this? It is highly doubtful, especially when you factor in our incredibly low lease rates.

It has opened the possibility of cars as social entities by allowing it to communicate back to their vehicle owners and their Trusted Mechanics. The car’s engine data is its digital signature. This vision has come true with the help of bluetooth-enabled OBD2 plugins and data loggers in smartphones. Cars can now be better understood which only a few years ago was only within the realm of auto mechanics.

The story of BraunAbility begins with founder, Ralph Braun. Diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy and unable to walk by the age of 15, he was determined to find a better way to stay mobile than being pushed in a manual chair and carried in and out of vehicles.  Ralph started by inventing the world’s first electric scooter, which he called the Tri-Wheeler. From there Ralph designed the world’s first wheelchair lift and steering controls, allowing Ralph to drive himself independently for the first time in his life.  Ralph quickly discovered that others just like him were hungry for that same independence. With just a handful of employees and despite overwhelming odds, Ralph started his business, and a new industry emerged.  Over the past four decades, BraunAbility products have revolutionized what independence means to wheelchair users. Today BraunAbility has over 1000 employees, all working to grow mobility across the world. Ralph Braun passed away in 2013, but his legacy is still the driving force behind the BraunAbility mission today.  As the world leader in mobility with over 40 years of experience, BraunAbility understands what you're looking for in wheelchair vans, wheelchair lifts and mobility products. Why? Because BraunAbility was founded by a man who needed that mobility for himself. Ralph Braun built his company on a commitment to quality, safety, and innovation. Ralph also believed in giving his customers the peace of mind that wherever their travels take them, there's an experienced mobility professional close by. Put your trust in the BraunAbility name and their nationwide dealer network.

Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/connected-signals-inc-,,https://twitter.com/ConnectedSigs,https://www.facebook.com/Connected-Signals-152962808055458/
