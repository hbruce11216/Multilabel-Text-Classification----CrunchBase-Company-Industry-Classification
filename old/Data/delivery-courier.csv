Because most of them still calling out numbers with clipboard in hand, place separate orders to multiple suppliers, sometimes have to handle delivery themselves, reordering, search and vetting of new suppliers is always a manual labor.  On the supplier side, it’s not looking any brighter: many smaller suppliers use printed spreadsheets or have to invest in costly purchase/ordering systems, oftentimes have to cover the delivery, employ an army of sales people, and acquiring new customers - a very costly process as well.  URSUP saves a huge amount of time and money for both suppliers and their customers by making the procurement process as easy as ordering a box of cookies from Instacart.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/ursup/,,,
