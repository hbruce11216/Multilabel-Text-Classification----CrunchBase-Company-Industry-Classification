In 1998, Joseph Pandolfino founded 22nd Century Limited, LLC (22nd Century) to provide funding to North Carolina State University (NCSU) for research and development collaboration on nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant. Mr. Pandolfino questioned, coffee without caffeine and beer without alcohol is commercially available so why aren’t tobacco cigarettes without nicotine a choice for consumers? Further, he hypothesized: If it were possible to produce tobacco cigarettes without nicotine, smokers could use these extraordinary cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. A paradox to be sure. Nonetheless, Mr. Pandolfino’s hypothesis stemmed from his careful observation of real smokers. As an importer of tobacco-free herbal cigarettes, Mr. Pandolfino had come to realize that some consumers were using nicotine-free herbal cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. Anecdotal evidence suggested that this approach was actually effective. The biggest problem with the novel “therapy” was the fact that herbal cigarettes have distinct taste and aroma characteristics which greatly limit their consumer appeal and acceptance. Indeed, although various processes were developed to improve these nicotine-free herbal cigarettes, it became clear that their peculiar taste and aroma characteristics would never appeal to mainstream smokers. If, on the other hand, a tobacco cigarette without nicotine could be developed, Mr. Pandolfino believed a new cigarette category could prove an attractive product choice to all smokers. With this in mind, Mr. Pandolfino set out to investigate the feasibility of efficiently producing tobacco cigarettes without nicotine.",,,,

ADispell research has revealed a novel mechanism that explains the onset of cognition loss and has discovered and validated lead compounds through in vivo experiments that interact favorably with the mechanism. The Company has performed successful laboratory work and has a scientific plan to make the technology attractive to the pharmaceutical industry for licensing.  ADispell operates a â€˜license in - add value â€“ license outâ€™ model that will result in a much faster investment payback than other pharmaceutical projects. This payback structure is based on licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties from product sales. The business has completed technology licensing from Cornell University and expects substantial income during the next three years, which will produce an attractive, rapid investment return.  The experienced ADispell management team will take the promising technology, patented by Cornell, and advance it into a robust development of interest to one or more â€˜big pharmaâ€™ companies, by proceeding through the middle, formative stages of the pharmaceutical drug development process, and then executing a license with a pharma development company. The licensing company is expected to develop at least one blockbuster drug for memory loss by completing the clinical trial stage of this process. This three-year ADispell project will proceed with investor and grant support in the first year and then with funding from pharmaceutical partners during years two and three. At least one significant payment event is expected at the end of three years as a pharma company licenses the technology for clinical trial and final development for sale. ADispell expects to stay involved with the project in an ongoing development role during this time. Longer term income (after 7 to 9 years) includes royalty payments based on the blockbuster drug sales with development milestone payments occurring in the time between these two payment periods.

Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients. Targeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands. Adnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion™. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates. In October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics.

Within all tumors there exists a diverse mix of immune cells. In particular their company is interested in T cells and their function within tumor-bearing hosts.  Some of these T cells are responding to new or overly expressed antigens that a tumor produces and are capable of destroying the tumor.  Others are actively shutting down the immune response to protect healthy tissue.  This dynamic and complex relationship is ongoing in the tumor microenvironment and is unique relative to blood.  For this reason we are in the process of identifying new immunotherapy targets by understanding the complexity of human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from several different tumor types.  Through our close alignment with the Earl A Chiles Research Institute at the Providence Cancer Center we have evaluated over a hundred tumor specimens obtained from surgery.  We process these samples as soon as they are obtained from the operating room in order to keep the immune phenotypes intact, which avoids changes that can occur during freezing or resting.  Differences in RNA array data have identified genes that are upregulated in either the activating and suppressive immune populations within the tumor microenvironment.  From this information they design and develop recombinant proteins, antibodies, or small molecules that block and/or activate novel immune-specific pathways.  These agents are currently being tested in a battery of immune-specific in-vitro human assays and in mouse tumor models with the ultimate goal of treating cancer patients.

The idea for APGR Green emerged as a way to eliminate pesky moles without causing damage to the environment, soil and water resources, pets and most importantly our children.

Testing in Texas and Louisiana proved his theory.  Out of extensive research and testing, Mole-Zap and Ant-Zap were born. Using food grade CO2 (used in sodas, sparkling water, fountain drinks, etc.), it was discovered that by displacing oxygen in mole burrows and ant mounds, the animal would simply go to sleep and not wake up. Finally, providing an environmentally safe solution to get rid of these pests that actually works.

Crenolanib is an orally administered, highly potent and selective, mutation-resistant pan-FLT3 inhibitor. To date, crenolanib has been evaluated in over 400 patients across 19 completed or ongoing clinical trials. In Phase I/II clinical trials of crenolanib combined with intensive chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory and newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, composite complete remission has been observed in 68% and 85% of patients, respectively, as evidenced by the reduction in leukemic blasts to less than or equal to 5% in the bone marrow. Based on these results, we have commenced two pivotal Phase III clinical trials of crenolanib in FLT3-mutated AML: one trial in relapsed or refractory patients, and another trial in newly diagnosed patients. Both of these ongoing clinical trials enrolled the first patient in August 2018. In addition to its observed activity in FLT3, in preclinical studies, crenolanib has also been observed to be a highly potent inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, receptors, and is being evaluated in several solid tumor indications where PDGF pathways are implicated as disease drivers. Given the compelling safety and clinical benefit observed thus far, we believe crenolanib has the potential to become a best-in-class therapeutic for multiple oncology indications. Our vision is to prolong the lives of cancer patients by advancing crenolanib in combination with standard of care chemotherapies as well as emerging therapies that offer the potential for synergistic treatment effects.

For some diseases that are self-resolving and for which antibiotics aren’t required (e.g., sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, skin abscesses), identification of antibiotic resistance remains a test tube phenomenon with little impact on patient outcomes.  More concerning illnesses, such as serious disease due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), resistance may indeed result in decreased effectiveness for some older drugs but many therapies still remain and many new therapies currently exist to treat MRSA.  Arrevus is focusing its drug development efforts on those diseases for which antibiotic resistance has important clinical implications and for which few therapies exist.

Biopharmaceuticals are much larger and more fragile than traditional small-molecule drugs. Due to their size, large doses of biologics are often required; and because of their fragility, these drugs must be administered by injection instead of orally. Biologics become unstable and extremely viscous at the high concentrations required for traditional low-volume injections. Consequently, they are frequently administered as high-volume, slow intravenous infusions in a hospital setting. From a patient perspective, receiving treatment via subcutaneous administration can be preferable to intravenous infusion. Subcutaneous administration removes the need for invasive IV ports. Administration at home eliminates time-intensive and expensive hospital visits. Achieving high doses of biologics in a volume suitable for subcutaneous administration presents significant formulation challenges. The major limiting factor is viscosity, which arises when biomolecules are formulated at high concentration.  Arsia’s mission is to produce high-concentration biopharmaceutical products with low viscosity, suitable for small-volume subcutaneous injection. Our proprietary platform technology reduces the viscosity of biologics through the addition of inactive ingredients (excipients). Because Arsia’s technology works at the formulation stage, the molecular structure of the drug itself is not affected. Arsia’s technology provides i) a formulation solution for new products in development that have viscosity challenges, ii) a life-cycle management strategy for existing products and iii) a way to differentiate those products from others on the market. For more information on partnering with Arsia, please contact us.",,,,
