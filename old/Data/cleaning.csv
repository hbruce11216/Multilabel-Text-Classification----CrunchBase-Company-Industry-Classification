Slowly, but surely, he began to learn how to make patterns, cut fabrics and sew pockets. Eventually, through observation and diligent study of fashion books, he learned how to make full custom suits. By the age of 23, he became a custom designer and tailor, designing, fitting, making patterns and crafting masterpieces. At the age of 29, Jay moved to New York with only $100 in his pocket. Jay found employment in New York at a dry cleaners as well as a sewing and manufacturing company, where he met Jackie, his current wife, and mother of their three children. One year later, Jay moved to Dallas, Texas. After another six years working in another tailor shop, Jay had saved enough to open his own business.

Our business is a start-up company that will initially purchase several profitable laundry operations in the target areas that meet our demographic criteria. We will upgrade these operations to accommodate our plans to market wash & fold services to a more affluent clientele in our region through feeder stores located in upscale neighborhoods and scheduled pick-up/drop-off services by van drivers. We are also developing a mobile software application for smart-phones, tablets, and PC’s that will allow easy scheduling and e-marketing of our services to the targeted locales. Since most laundromat costs are fixed, (i.e. equipment and rent), the increased utilization of existing equipment and facilities will increase productivity, and also growth in revenues & profits. By upgrading an old and outdated business model for the modern and mobile world we anticipate a growing awareness and utilization of our company and its services. We are targeting an underserved market segment, by outsourcing a time consuming household task, through a reasonably priced and easily arranged service operation. We believe that the combination of an already profitable and well understood business model with a modern, convenient, and reliable service business is a winning combination with substantial growth potential and limited financial risk.",,,,
