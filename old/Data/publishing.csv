More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.  Professors include Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), and Andre Knoesen & Raj Amirtharajah (UC Davis).

The monthly newsletter deals with safe investments, and critiques the state of the current market, to explore what the best moves are for new and veteran investors right now.  Porter has the pedigree to be a respected financial advisor as well.  His biggest claim to fame was actually predicting the mortgage crisis well before it hit the United States.  Porter Stansberry was also the first American editor of Britain's longest running financial newsletter, the Fleet Street Letter. Currently  Stansberry Research provides more than 20 expert financial analysts that regularly create educational and analytical articles related to finance and global economics. The range of viewpoints held by those analysts represents one of the strengths of Stansberry Research. Rather than present one unified view of financial markets to which all analysts must adhere, the publisher instead promotes what it calls its mosaic of opinions, encouraging each analyst to utilize their own expertise when crafting their work. In this way, readers are presented with a diverse range of thoughts and can better utilize the information that is most relevant to their personal financial sensibilities and goals. This method of operation is derived from the publisher’s desire to provide only the highest quality analysis to readers. That drive is codified in the two basic principles that guide the firm’s actions. The first of these is a commitment to giving customers the information that those at the firm would want if their roles were reversed. The second principle is a pledge to work with analysts whose viewpoints they’d feel comfortable having their friends and families follow.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/stansberry-research,,http://twitter.com/Stansberry,http://www.facebook.com/StansberryandAssociates,"107,094"

These markets are growing 50 percent faster than the national average. In each of its daily newspaper markets, McClatchy operates the leading local website, offering readers information, comprehensive news, advertising, e-commerce and other services. The McClatchy Company dates to the California Gold Rush era of 1857, when James McClatchy was one of the founding editors of its first newspaper, The Sacramento Bee -- one of the oldest newspapers in the West. Coverage of California's Central Valley expanded with the founding of The Fresno Bee in 1922 and the purchase of The Modesto Bee in 1927. For more than a century, California was the cornerstone of the company. In 1979, McClatchy expanded into the Northwest with the purchase of the Anchorage Daily News and the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, Wash. In 1986, The News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash., was added to McClatchyâ€™s growing family of newspapers. The company went public in February 1988 and its Class A common shares are listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MNI. The companyâ€™s Class B common stock, which controls a majority of shareholder voting power, is not publicly traded. In 1990, McClatchy began publishing on the East Coast with the purchase of three daily newspapers in South Carolina: The Herald in Rock Hill, The Island Packet on Hilton Head Island, and The Beaufort Gazette. In 2004, McClatchy purchased the Merced Sun-Star and five affiliated non-dailies in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. The newspapers, situated between Modesto and Fresno, serve a fast-growing region and provided a good strategic fit with McClatchyâ€™s other Central Valley papers. In 2006, McClatchy purchased Knight Ridder Inc. to become the second-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. Of Knight Ridderâ€™s 32 daily newspapers, McClatchy immediately announced its intentions to sell 12 that didn't fit its longstanding acquisition philosophy of buying newspapers in fast-growing markets. The 20 daily newspapers retained in the Knight Ridder acquisition were: The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, Calif.; The Bellingham Herald and The Olympian in Washington; The Idaho Statesman in Boise; The Kansas City Star in Missouri; The Olathe News and The Wichita Eagle in Kansas; the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Texas; the Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois; the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer and The Telegraph in Georgia; the Sun Herald in Biloxi, Miss.; the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky; the Centre Daily Times in Pennsylvania; The Miami Herald, Bradenton Herald and El Nuevo Herald in Florida; The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina; and The Sun News and The State in South Carolina. As part of its analysis of the Knight Ridder acquisition, McClatchy sold the Star Tribune in 2007. The sale of its largest newspaper made McClatchy the third-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. In 2008, The Olathe News converted from daily publication to twice-weekly.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-mcclatchy-company,,http://twitter.com/McClatchyCo,http://www.facebook.com/McClatchyCo,"129,840"

Their work has been cited in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Time magazine, The Washington Post and USA Today. In 1985, McKenna launched California County magazine in partnership with the California State Association of Counties. Early to recognize the impact new digital technologies would have on the public sector, in 1987, Dennis launched Government Technology, the first national magazine covering information technology in state and local government. Other successful media platforms followed, including Public CIO and Emergency Management. All have won numerous editorial and design awards. In 2013, Emergency Management magazine was named Magazine of the Year for overall excellence by ASBPE (American Society of Business Publication Editors), Public CIO was named Magazine of the Year in 2007 and Government Technology and Emergency Management have both been named best publication in their respective categories by the Western Publishing Association. Seeing the need for stronger analysis and research to support public sector innovation, Dennis developed the Center for Digital Government—the first-of-its-kind research and business intelligence advisory institute focused exclusively on state and local government. The Center is home to the widely cited Digital States Survey. In 2009, e.Republic acquired Governing from Congressional Quarterly. Governing covers politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. Recognized as the most credible and authoritative voice in its field, Governing provides non-partisan news, insight and analysis on budget and finance; transportation and infrastructure; workforce and economic development; health and human services and more. Since the acquisition, the publication has grown, with an expanded online presence and launch of the Governing Institute, headed by former Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser.

Since 2006 their daily dose of ‘News to Enthuse’ has confirmed for thousands of fans what they already knew to be true — that good news itself is not in short supply; the broadcasting of it is. Thomas Jefferson said the job of journalists was to portray accurately what was happening in society. The Good News Network was founded because the media was failing to report on the positive. In the 1990’s while homicide rates in the U.S. plummeted by 42 percent, television news coverage of murders surged more than 700 percent, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs. The editor Norman Cousins once said, “If news is not really news unless it is bad news, it may be difficult to claim they are an informed nation.”",,,http://twitter.com/GoodNewsNetwork,http://www.facebook.com/thegoodnewsnetwork,"206,883"
