Ximple Solutions is an ERP platform that unifies your entire organization onto one integrated business software suite. The real-time flow of information with customers, suppliers and your employees is made simple and efficient giving you the power to optimize your business performance. Ximple Solutions provides the optimal platform to advance your business.. Built with industry-specific focus, it provides a strategic foundation that will integrate your entire enterprise on one platform, enabling you to excel in today’s competitive marketplace. Who we are We design and develop ERP software applications for medium to large size businesses around the world and provide technology consulting services. We are a leading provider of ERP solution to Electrical, Plumbing and HVAC industry. Ximple Solutions covers a full range of business requirements including sales, purchase, finance, accounting, inventory control, customer relationship management, warehouse management, and specialized needs of our clients. Our Vision Ximple intelligent ERP innovation roadmap includes a mix of artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on user experience, cloud and the internet of things (IoT) that will support broader global digital business models. We plan to transform ERP software from a system of records to a system of engagement, intelligence, and ultimately a system of decisions.  Currently, most of the ERP software are stuck with the system of records and this reality is with legacy systems that aren’t correctly built for easy integration and they slow down the digital transformation. To make it worse there is still quite a lot of manual data entry going on. Today everyone expects the same ease of use from enterprise applications as they do from any other solution. It needs to be intuitive, easy and user-centric or it simply won’t be used at all.  We need to take user experience into account and even put it front and center, combined with a mobile-first approach and soon the new types of interfaces enabling to interact with  Natural Language Processing as part of the enabling mix. A whopping 85% plus percent of ERP users would abandon enterprise software for disconnected spreadsheets, defeating the purpose of an enterprise application, when confronted with poor software usability. The role of the customer experience and user experience can’t be underestimated in any system or application nowadays. In short, gone are the days that IT is decided on a network and users simply had to use it. Currently, there isn’t a lot of intelligent ERP and integration of IoT, massive data analytics, cognitive and process automation, let alone autonomous processes and decisions going on yet.  Digital transformation is about information, people, experiences, speed, timing, convenience, operations, automation and interconnectedness/collaboration. Intelligent ERP is a system of integration – connecting with other applications for advanced end-to-end business process automation. Intelligent ERP on the most basic level as the ERP becoming a system of engagement, a method of insight and intelligence, a system of decisions and system of integration and connectivity instead of just a system of records. ERP applications fulfill so many tasks in business process optimization in areas such as order management and processing, in data collection, in planning on an enterprise production level and hooking up with other systems (HR, invoice processing and accounting, shipping, warehouse management, CRM, materials management, procurement and supplier management and so on), the far-reaching possibilities of intelligent ERP become all the more precise and vast. This is especially so if we add that inherent technological dimension of ‘intelligence’ to it, which among others, refers to components such as predictive analytics, machine learning and autonomous decisions and actions. The state and future of intelligent ERP as the Industry 4.0 autonomous decision center on the business process level. To facilitate success to the Ximple product roadmap and align with Industry 4.0 we have invested heavily in R & D and built a large team of engineers to revamp and re-architect  Ximple ERP system.  We plan to make ERP solution API  driven to allow easy integration to various systems and IoT devices, designed to make the user interface customer and user-centric and infuse artificial intelligence for autonomous business decisions on the business process level. Our background It took several years of hard work and dedication from Carlos and his team, working closely with the distributors and finding out their needs and solutions to it. From there Ximple Solutions came to life and had been helping small and mid size distributors grow their business to a next level.

","ViridisChem is a software company that has built the world’s largest toxicity database, and is developing SaaS, AI platform for toxicity evaluation of products and ingredients.  Increasingly strict global regulations, litigation risks, and industry-wide push for cost reduction has created an urgent need for toxicity evaluations of not just the end-products, but also the starting materials.  By screening out toxic drug targets, avoiding the use of toxic raw material, pharma and biochem companies can avoid many months of wasted R&D time, minimize the toxic waste generation, and avoid costly late-stage manufacturing changes. End result: less time and money needed to bring drug to market. For consumer sectors, by minimizing the use of toxic raw materials and formulations, they can minimize the risk of late-stage manufacturing changes, and increase govt. compliance, and brand recognition. What do we offer?: 1)	Toxicity of less than 0.1% of chemicals is known. Scientists rely on material data-sheets, but 80% of these are either inaccurate or incomplete. We offer toxicity evaluation of all chemicals, including new molecules 2)	Companies are having difficulty in keeping track of worldwide frequently changing government regulations and chemical threshold. We provide up-to-date compliance and chemical threshold information 3)	Within consumer industries, suppliers don’t disclose formulation ingredients (their IP), and they cannot accurately predict toxicity of their formulations, because the models that take into account the % composition of chemicals, and their interactions within mixtures don’t exist.  We are building such models using machine-learning algorithms ensuring increasing accuracy.  By offering accurate toxicity related information throughout R&D, ViridisChem will lead the standardization of toxicity evaluation across all industries Our Solution: We have built the most comprehensive toxicity database with over 90 million chemicals and 2.4 billion properties, curated using AI techniques, and are offering through yearly subscription, an AI powered SaaS software platform that provides toxicity evaluation (related to ecological, health and safety) of any chemical, even the new molecules, identifies local, regional, and per country regulatory issues and established thresholds related to the chemical use, allowing scientists to eliminate high-risk drug candidates. And minimize the use of toxic raw material. This is the Industry-first off-the-shelf toxicity evaluation product offering real-time toxicity evaluation of any chemical, even the new molecules. This much needed solution is proving to be so powerful, that ViridisChem received recognition by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for offering solutions that will most benefit sustainability.

These failures equate to billions of dollars in lost opportunity for trial sponsors every year - but more importantly, patients don't have time to wait for us to get it right.  In the digital age, humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision.

First Steps In Early Robotics & Automation Researchers in Artificial Intelligence have always dreamed of building the artificial person. Up until 1986, the best they could do were mobile platforms that carefully looked at the world (with cameras and sonar), analyzed what was going on, figured out what to do next, and then did it. This made robots that worked at a snail’s pace, sometimes standing motionless for minutes on end. Then in 1986, a new idea emerged. Inspired by the way animals behave and humans carry out the routine activities of ordinary life, a new band of robotic engineers started designing much higher functioning robots that could move about the world very quickly. These robots were able to sense the world and act (or react) in less than a second. Now they had robots that could travel down hallways without hitting people, track moving objects, and even open doors.",,,https://twitter.com/traclabs,https://www.facebook.com/pages/TRACLabs-Inc/169027446551

Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing Big Data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks. TieSet is developing a decentralized federated learning platform that preserves privacy while distributing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and gathered locally on edge AI devices, TieSet’s low latency platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate at scale while offline. Our message is simple enough “creating, distributing, and organizing intelligence around the world“, not big data. We believe that human beings mainly share intelligence, as our brain is not designed to store big data, rather designed to forget unnecessary information. Instead, we create huge virtual intelligence in distributed but collaborative ways. That is the world TieSet envisions for the next generation of technologies: Intelligence is the one that is exchanged over the Internet, not just big data.

Research started in 2001.,"Syntience Inc. is developing a computer algorithm for generalized Understanding. The initial goal is a system capable of learning and truly understanding any human language by unsupervised learning from a pure text corpus in the target language. Language understanding requires some amount of world understanding which will be learned while learning the language. The algorithm is called Artificial Intuition and is a ""West Pole"" style Deep Neural Network with a significant feature overlap with Deep Learning but is more suited for understanding streamed data such as text, voice, and DNA sequences. Development and experiments with the algorithm started by Monica Anderson in January 2001, which makes her a pioneer of Deep Neural Network research since Deep Learning only became widely known in 2012. The basis of the algorithm is the recognition that the biggest problem in AI is the ""Reduction"" problem. How can a machine get from a low level description, such as a picture, or text in a book, to a high level understanding of what is depicted or described. Deep Learning and its variants, like LSTM, have solidly demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks can perform this Reduction process, autonomously, which lends serious support to the idea that other Deep Networks could do this even better, and with additional advantages like easier language generation, semi-reified concepts (which help in debugging and patching problems in running systems), and very low resource consumption (for instance, GPUs are not needed). The algorithm itself is kept as trade secret but high level discussion of the principles (especially Reduction) is available on videos and papers reachable from our links page at http://syntience.com/links The business plan is to finish algorithm development and then license it (in a safe form that cannot be reverse engineered) to any companies that require a language understanding capability in any language. Future applications include Semantic Search, Legal Discovery, spam and hate speech filters, intelligent mail reflectors, research assistants capable of reading and understanding large amounts of research reports, news filters and aggregators,  machine translation, summarization, automatic copy editing, etc.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/syntience,,http://twitter.com/pandemonica,https://www.facebook.com/pandemonica

No code for the other 99%.,"A behavior change is underway. Many experts agree that the majority of human interaction with technology will be voice-driven by 2030. What does that mean for business? Does voice have a place in the workplace? The programming tools and languages available for today’s creators share a fundamental flaw:  they require steep learning curves to translate your ideas into software. The act of translating is the problem, not the solution. Imagine you could talk to a computer, what would that interaction look like? Would you be thinking of boxes and wires, diagrams, or code? Or would you be communicating your ideas naturally, as if talking to a colleague? After all, that is how most software is made today: someone shares an idea with a programmer who translates it into a computer language.  Consumer AI assistance, like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, provides a glimpse into the future of work. Just like consumer AI, workplace AI assistance will start with simple conversations with your computer: as questions of your data, generate simple workflows and automate tasks. The days of navigating through endless tools, dragging boxes, connecting wires, copy-pasting data, exporting and importing, or asking programmers to translate ideas into computer code will not age well. The future of human-to-computer interface is destined to be more natural - in our language, not theirs.  Storyscript is a workplace AI assistant that provides a novel, intuitive, and powerful experience to create as naturally as storytelling — we’re evolved to tell stories, not write code.

Except for the most routine cases, hunting for these insights requires grappling with complex, difficult-to-learn interfaces or tedious programming. Questions about data that take moments to formulate can take hours or much longer to answer. SkyPhrase aims to change this. With SkyPhrase, you can pose a question in simple natural language, and our artificial intelligence technology will figure out what you mean, and how to answer. Our goal is to make it easy to use all data this simply. Our web analytics and football statistics services are early steps towards achieving this goal. At SkyPhrase, our approach to natural language understanding is different because of our goals and because of our technology. We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer. If you have a data set or API you would like to access with natural language, let us know. Stay tuned as we expand SkyPhrase to more areas, make it more powerful and enable third parties to use our technology for their own data and applications.",,,,
