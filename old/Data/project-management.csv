AchieveIt is the solution organizations use to get their biggest, most important initiatives out of the boardroom and into reality.  We look at ideas and say – Let’s actually do this.™  It all started in 2010, when we were doing strategy consulting for hospitals. Back then we were primarily consultants, with a limited leave-behind software to help track and monitor the plan we had built together.  But over and over, we noticed our clients’ strategic plans were being supported by a bunch of different kinds of plans, with each individual team using their own methods to track and report. What our clients really needed was a way to manage across these integrated plans at the same time, and to be able to see all supporting goals and activities from all their plans, in one view.  So, we supercharged our software and services to help them get everything in view, get everyone engaged, and get every possible advantage. What resulted was an entirely new approach to organizational execution: Integrated Plan Management.  Today, all kinds of organizations turn to AchieveIt for Integrated Plan Management – everyone from utility companies working on new forms of energy, to government agencies looking to reduce taxpayer expenses, to Fortune 500s trying to launch new growth initiatives.

Since 1985, FlightTime.com has specialized in providing premium air charter to travelers worldwide.

FlightTime.com’s extensive presence with offices in Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Bremen, and Milan puts us in a unique position to ensure that even the most complex travel missions, whether domestic or international, are a success. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, February 2, 2000 Flight Time Corporation, the global leader in air charter, today announced it will acquire Wyvern Ltd., an industry-leading safety and compliance auditing firm, and MACH-1 Software Corporation, a provider of aviation enterprise management software, and rename the company FlightTime.com. FlightTime.com will leverage the well-known safety and superior technology components associated with Wyvern and MACH-1 with the company’s existing e-commerce site AirCharter.com to create the first, audited global aviation network. FlightTime.com also announced it has received substantial financial backing from Southeast Interactive Technology Funds (SEI) and BancBoston Ventures to fund the company’s rapid growth, extensive future technology investments and commitment toward the marketing and distribution of charter going forward. “Until now, the charter industry has lacked a single one-stop resource to find and book aircraft from an aviation network, ” said Robert McBride, president of FlightTime.com. “With these acquisitions and new funds, FlightTime.com will integrate global supply and distribution to create an “end-to-end” network built on a single platform, providing real-time access to a global fleet of audited aircraft residing on a single, intelligent system via the Internet.” The acquisition of Wyvern Ltd. is one component of FlightTime.com’s move to create a seamless and fully integrated solution for the aviation industry by using the company’s extensive expertise and objective information on the safety, quality and service of specific aircraft and operators on four continents. The comprehensive standards of performance provided by Wyvern cover areas of operations, auditing, management and administration, flight operations and maintenance. Wyvern Ltd. will operate independently of FlightTime.com as a wholly-owned subsidiary. “Wyvern reinforces FlightTime.com’s commitment to providing a world-class aviation solution,” said Walter Lamon, III, president of Wyvern Ltd. “They intend to extend the network aggressively over the next eighteen months as part of their goal to create a fully audited network.” “Incorporating Wyvern data into the FlightTime.com business is an important step in their ability to offer global access to the most credible and reliable safety information in the aviation industry, ” said Jane McBride, founder and chief executive officer of Flight Time. “Their clients depend on operators cleared by Wyvern, which is synonymous with quality, safety and reliability.” MACH-1’s advanced technology and design will provide the technological infrastructure for FlightTime.com. MACH-1 is the most advanced software product available to the general and business aviation market that integrates a variety of complex aviation software functions into a seamless system, increasing productivity, supporting extensive business and industry intelligence, and eliminating data-entry duplication. With the acquisition, FlightTime.com has purchased the exclusive global aviation rights to use Visual Knowledge™, the proprietary development platform upon which MACH-1 is built.

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization. Increase collaboration, drive sales, build better relationships, and deliver optimized omnichannel customer experiences. The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more.

It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's hidden services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses. Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their workers to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country, without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization. Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members' online privacy and security. Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recommend Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. Corporations use Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to protect sensitive procurement patterns from eavesdroppers. They also use it to replace traditional VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of communication. Which locations have employees working late? Which locations have employees consulting job-hunting websites? Which research divisions are communicating with the company's patent lawyers? A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently. Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting operations. The variety of people who use Tor is actually part of what makes it so secure. Tor hides you among the other users on the network, so the more populous and diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected.",https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10681658/,,https://www.twitter.com/torproject,https://www.facebook.com/TorProject/

Latest versions of work are posted online, and clients  give feedback and submit approvals online to allow the creative review process to proceed more efficiently. In 2004, Workzone expanded its offerings with the introduction of its Project Tracker tool, an online, easy-to-use alternative to traditional offline project management tools. Workzone serves a middle ground, with a more robust feature set than entry-level tools (like Basecamp) and a shorter learning curve than more advanced, complicated tools, like Microsoft Project. Workzone features a projects dashboard to give a birds-eye view of all projects across the entire organization. Individualized to-do lists let each team member see what's on his/her plate; updates are reflected automatically in the full project plans. Automated, emailed reports allow team members to access project or task information from any desktop, tablet or smartphone.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/workzone,,http://twitter.com/workzone,http://www.facebook.com/workzone

The to-do provides one single source of everything you have to do to effectively organize your work, projects, personal and extended social life. The uncluttered simple list can be continuously used for planning and staying organized. In addition, there is a simple “WhatsApp” like conversation/collaboration platform that allows one to communicate with anyone inside or outside the organization. One can not only send messages, but also request for responses and approvals, schedule meetings, conduct surveys and polls with a capability to even further extend by adding your own simple workflows and additional context. Think of the simplicity of “WhatsApp” that is extended to become highly structured and accountable. The solution also provides a birds eye view on everything that matters to you, be it your personal to-dos, people you are dependent upon and those that depend on you, your family and your projects. It also allows planning around more sophisticated projects, sharing and managing documents, and tracking completion of the projects. With the growing popularity of mobile devices, Zapty is designed to provide a seamless multi-screen responsive user experience for simultaneous and synchronous usage of devices while getting your work done.
