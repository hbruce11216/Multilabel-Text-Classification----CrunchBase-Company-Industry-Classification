Well... you couldn't. But now you can! There are many wonderful websites, apps & guides out there to help people discover bars in their city. A simple search of these resources will conclude that almost all sports bars play a wide range of games. However, many do favor a handful of specific teams and those places truly are your best chances for a great time! BarChannels.com was created to bring like-minded sports fans together at the best places to watch their favorite teams. The 5 Commandments May we never stray from our founding principles: 1. All bar listings shall be kept accurate and up-to-date by our editors. 2. Reviews & ratings shall be informative, helpful and un-biased. 3. This site shall never be overrun with ads, pop-ups or promotions. 4. Simplicity is key, while maintaining sexy aesthetic standards. 5.

foosye,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/foosye,https://www.foosye.com,"Android, Developer Tools, Food Trucks, Information Technology, iOS, Mobile, SaaS, Web Apps","Apps, Food and Beverage, Information Technology, Mobile, Platforms, Software",Foosye is a market maker for the food truck industry that eliminates obstacles which confines the success of food truck markets.,"Foosye® began in 2014 with a small group of entrepreneurs who had a vision – to eliminate “drive, park and pray” within the mobile food truck industry. The food truck industry has gained significant momentum over the past 5 years, growing from an estimated $650 Million in revenue in 2012 to an estimated $5.9 Billion in 2017. And yet, food truck owners and operators are challenged with balancing demand and supply to achieve profitability. Inspired by Co-Founder Ray Chow, two long-term foodies and an experienced restaurant and food truck owner came together to help solve the drive, park and pray challenge and create a platform that connects the world’s mobile food industry. Our mission is simple: to amplify food truck operations utilizing technology, predictive analytics and IoT on a food truck. By connecting what we believe are 10 unique customer segments into a robust ecosystem, Foosye® will offer an industry-wide platform that enables communication, scalable and repeatable processes and ultimately profitability for this growing industry segment. Foosye® is much more than a technology – it is a platform that connects the mobile food industry.  In 2015, Foosye® filed a patent for our platform technology and processes. Our patent is bigger than just the mobile food industry, and supports all mobile retail. Given the popularity and continued growth of the food industry, mobile food trucks are our primary market entrance. Long-term, the Foosye® platform will be used to enable other mobile vendors, including mobile clothing retailers, pop-up markets, etc. The food truck industry is more robust and dynamic than meets the eye. Ten unique customer segments not only influence and effect the industry, but also represent revenue streams for the Foosye® platform. These segments include: Food Truck Owners		General Public			Advertisers Event Coordinators		Vendors/Suppliers		Commissaries Trade Associations		Government			Municipalities 	 Food Truck Parks & Lots				 Contrary to common misconception, all food trucks are not the same. Each is unique in its capacity to balance marketing and operating a business while taking care of the paying customer at the window. Event coordinators and consumers are also key constituents in the mobile food community; without these there is no demand for the trucks. Foosye® solves this challenge by offering an industry-wide, data-driven platform that allows mobile food truck owners to focus on the customer at the window while leveraging predictive analytics and simple dashboards to make better decisions on when and where to operate their trucks. The Foosye® platform simultaneously allows event coordinators and consumers to engage directly with food trucks. In an increasing mobile society connected via social technologies, the mobile food truck industry is poised to dominate consumer interest over the next 3 to 5 years.

It is a family friendly program by the [North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/north-american-aerospace-defense-command), the United States and Canada bi-national organization charged with the missions of aerospace warning and aerospace control for North America. This tradition was started after a local store’s advertisement for kids to call Santa on a special “hotline” included a misprinted telephone number. Instead of reaching Mr. Kris Kringle, the number put kids through to the CONAD Commander-in-Chief’s operations “hotline.” The Director of Operations, Colonel Harry Shoup, received the first “Santa” call and had his staff check radar data to see if there was any indication of Santa making his way south from the North Pole. Indeed, there were signs of Santa, and children who called in were given an update on Santa’s position. Thus, the tradition was born. NORAD Tracks Santa was launched in 1955.",,,http://twitter.com/NoradSanta,http://www.facebook.com/noradsanta

Instead of long difficult to share URLs, what if you could navigate the web by simply inputting a word or phrase without the for https, .coms, or /'s. What if you could verbally share URLs & more? Yumber is empowering people to create their own VRLs (verbal resource locators) which serve as simple verbal pathways to information that is difficult to remember and share. Instead of having to share difficult information through email, social media, or print, with this new technology you can share complex information verbally with ease. These VRLs, or as they are called, Yumbers, allow you to share hard to remember information such as physical addresses, phone numbers, URLs, etc. by simply attaching the target ( to a word or phrase which can easily be spoken and remembered by someone else.  Whether you are trying to share your new address with a long lost friend you met at the market, or a funny YouTube video with an audience of thousands, you can do so simply and verbally by telling them the Yumber. So what is a Yumber? A Yumber is a word or phrase that redirects the user to a specific target. A target can be a URL, phone number, physical address, email address, file, collection of files, photos, etc. virtually anything you want to share can be tied to a Yumber and then shared verbally face to face, over the radio, on the tv, or from a stage to thousands of people.  Try it yourself, goto Yumber.com and enter the Yumber:  One man band  You will find yourself watching a YouTube video located at a complicated YouTube URL without requiring you to speak the computer language necessary to read that lengthy YouTube address:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMuWi0dUBc  So what is a Yumber? It is natural, it is the marriage of word of mouth and technology, it is the way you learned to speak from birth, which technology, until now, has attempted to train out of you. With Yumber.com you can share anything with anyone anywhere using a simple word or phrase that you created for that purpose.  Why tell someone I will email you the link later, Or I will email you the file later, when you can simply tell them the associated Yumber to the target now and allow them to look it up at their convenience? The Internet was created by techies for techies. However, even these techies realized the need to evolve the Internet when the number of sites grew to the point at which it become difficult to remember all of the IP addresses of the new sites.  In its infancy the Internet was navigates by using IP addresses such as 192.168.0.1. To simplify navigation the a second layer was created, which is the domain name based system we still use today. This domain name system, complete with https, .coms, and /'s alike, is still on the level with the old and unintuitive MS DOS command prompt.  Just as Apple evolved the computer with its intuitive and human friendly operating system, Yumber is seeking to evolve the sharing of technology by adding another layer of simplicity that is more intuitive than the last. Instead of humans having to conform with the confines of computer language as defined by technology, Yumber adds a layer of humanity to technology allowing people to share themselves and their interests verbally in face to face settings.  Whether one on one, or while presenting to large audiences, Yumber helps you to put the power back in word of mouth communication.",,,http://twitter.com/yumber,

Unlike other call recorders (Skype, Hangouts, Zoom, Phone) that record all voices – including VoIP distortion – on the host's computer, Zencastr records each participant separately on their local computer in pristine quality. Simply send a web link to your guests and they will automatically join you in a live VoIP connection.  Press record and each participant's audio is recorded directly from their local microphone without any VoIP compression, artifacts, or dropouts. Once the recording is complete, each solo track is uploaded to the Zencastr cloud as well as conveniently synced to the host's preferred cloud drive (Dropbox or Google Drive). Featuring a foolproof design and relentless focus on quality, Zencastr is the perfect tool for brand new podcasters and veterans alike.  Optionally record in high quality MP3 or lossless 16-bit WAV.  Having a separate track per participant makes editing a snap.  Don't want to mix the tracks yourself?  Zencastr's 'Automatic Postproduction' service will mix the tracks for you and perform a specialized set of audio enhancements to provide you with a professional sounding mix ready for publishing in minutes. The software starts with an 8-hour-per-month hobbyist tier for free, or a $20-per-month professional tier which includes lossless WAV recording, Automatic Postproduction, and unlimited guests and recording time.",,,https://twitter.com/zencastr,https://www.facebook.com/zencaster/
