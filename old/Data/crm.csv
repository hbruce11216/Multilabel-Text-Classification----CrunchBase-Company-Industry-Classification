We are in the early growth stages of taking our product to market and are hiring.  LRM is a new category of product that fills a major void in the education technology market by helping organizations to organize complex learning relationships and ensure that all learners benefit from them.  Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems are essential to execute the transactions of modern education and they drive efficiency and standardization. But they do so at the expense of relationships.  And we think that relationships are absolutely essential to learning. People are motivated to learn because the content is related to their long term goals. They learn in context of their relationships with peers, teachers, mentors, and a community of other learners. They learn because they want to progress and form relationships with companies and societies that require expertise and credentials.  If you analyze the most pernicious problems in education from the skills gap to attrition to professional development, you’ll find inadequate learning relationships to be at the root cause of everything.  Most learning organizations understand this and are trying to fill that relationship void with Customer Relationship Management software. But CRM is designed for sales and is insufficient to the task of managing learning relationships because CRMs treat the contact as a passive participant to be acted upon by sales people. Fidelis’ LRM recognizes that learners have to be active drivers of their own success and provides them a beautiful way to organize the relationships that they need to succeed.  Given how important learning is to every organization, to society, and to democracy, we think that someone is going to build a multi-billion dollar company selling LRMs - we hope it's us.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/fidelis-inc/,,https://twitter.com/fidelised,,"25,964"

Relationships matter. Sometimes in the hi-tech world they live in today, it’s easy to forget that. But they have always been keenly aware that the point of a good CRM system is to help build better relationships, and that all of their features should meet that criteria. After years of success in the recruitment industry, the founders of TrackerRMS grew increasingly frustrated that the CRM systems available in the market weren’t really built from a recruitment industry insider’s perspective.  There were a lot of venture-funded CRM platforms targeting the industry with big investments backing them, but none of them really seemed to ‘get’ the business from the perspective of someone that was actually in the trenches of the industry every day. So after six successful years of owning and running a recruitment business, David Alonso decided to sell and form TrackerRMS with Andy Jones, committed to building a CRM that is 100% focused on the recruitment industry, and has equal focus on relationships and the bottom line.  Their mutual passion for recruitment and building better business systems provided the fuel to get TrackerRMS started, and they quickly launched their initial product with good traction straight away.  Customers understood that the founders of TrackerRMS knew the market well, and realized that their personal experience helped build a product that would work for recruiters as well as business owners.  At TrackerRMS, their team is committed to always remembering that relationships are the foundation of success for their customers.  Their vision is to continue to support the SMB space and to help them grow their recruitment businesses by using TrackerRMS to build better relationships and to run their operations more effectively--the end result being increased growth and profitability, which is what their customers are all ultimately after.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/255252,,https://www.twitter.com/tracker_rms,https://www.facebook.com/trackerrms,"48,669"

With one junior sales rep we closed 157 stores in our first 15 months, and became the fastest growing software in ACE hardware's history.

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization.

The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more.

Applications are software programs and/or presentation layers that enable users to automate a discrete enterprise function. Examples include ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning), general ledger, human resources, manufacturing, order capture, sales and marketing and other back-to-front office functions. For vertical-industry applications, we define them in the similar vein - meaning that these applications are designed to perform any one of the five following functions - back-office, front-office, customer information management, operations and specialized capabilities like Picture Archiving Applications for healthcare providers. Other examples of vertical-industry applications include Fulfillment in Communications, Project Costing in construction, Catering in Leisure and Lodging, Claims Processing in insurance, Point-Of-Sale in retail, Smart Metering Infrastructure in utilities, and Student Information Systems in education.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/apps-run-the-world,,http://twitter.com/appsruntheworld,https://www.facebook.com/AppsRunTheWorld,"157,849"

That concept was that there had to be a better, faster, less-complicated way to deliver on the promise of CRM. Together, this group founded OKERE, INC, one of the most successful enterprise salesforce.com consulting partners in history. OKERE was successful because of this philosophy, the quality of the team and OKEREâ€™s focus on a specific vertical industry that allowed the team to accelerate time to value for customers through shared best practices.

Shortly thereafter, roundCornerâ€™s founders began searching for new vertical markets that would benefit from the value proposition of cloud computing, be rich with innovative talent yet hamstrung by the current economic conditions and market forces. Equally important, they felt strongly that their next venture should focus on making a significant, positive social impact and that the Salesforce.com Foundation was the best vehicle for this social change. After collaborating with the President and CIO of Villanova University, the founders made a conscious, informed decision to launch roundCorner and become the Salesforce.com Foundationâ€™s premier solution partner.

Kunversion,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kunversion,https://kunversion.info/,"CRM, Lead Generation, Real Estate","Information Technology, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing, Software",Kunversion is a provider of website design and online marketing services to real estate businesses.,"The year was 2001, 'Drops of Jupiter' by Train was endlessly playing on the radio. People still listened to the radio. Google AdWords just came out. Most local real estate boards just started to allow access to this new thing called IDX. A college student named Justin Tracy had an idea to combine PPC (pay per click) with IDX (internet data exchange) and after a summer of hard drinking... I mean programming, he created a product known as Realty Generator. After a few months of going at it solo, he got a call from a mortgage broker named Tom Ray. Tom flew him out to Colorado and a partnership was born. The two ran Realty Generator for six years generating well over one million leads and a ton of very happy customers. They sold Realty Generator to Market Leader in 2007, to take a well needed break. After a legally mandated three year hiatus, the two got back on the saddle in 2011 and started Kunversion. Kunversion was dreamt up to take advantage of all the new technological features the Internet has offered in the last few years. From cloud computing to HTML5, we took advantage of all the newest technology when building Kunversion. We are constantly building new features within Kunversion. It's all done in house, never farmed out overseas. That goes for our customer support as well. All our agents including our chat operators are located in the good ol' US of A. We pride ourselves on taking your feedback seriously. Most support tickets are remedied the day they come in, and most new feature requests are done within a week. The world of real estate technology is a very fluid one. Between the Zillows and Realtor.coms trying to take over the world and the economy trying to dig itself out of that hole, the future isn't very certain. We believe it is up to the small and medium-sized brokerages to take back control and establish their place in the market. This can only happen by taking control of the content they own, their listings... and using them on a website owned and controlled by them. This website has to rival the experience they will get on the big venture capital funded websites, including a fully functional mobile application. This will generate leads for the brokerage at the lowest possible cost. This will also ensure listing data is accurate and that leads are followed up on immediately and not stagnating in some lead warehouse angering the potential homebuyer. Without getting all political on you guys, we just want to let you know we are on your side. One of our co-founders owns his own real estate company (www.wrightinnyack.com) so we have a vested interest in helping small to mid-sized brokerages navigate the minefield of modern real estate technology.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/kunversion-llc/,,http://twitter.com/kunversion,http://www.facebook.com/kunversion,"204,925"

In the early days, the desktop version of the software was on the forefront of database marketing and management for the remodeling industry.
