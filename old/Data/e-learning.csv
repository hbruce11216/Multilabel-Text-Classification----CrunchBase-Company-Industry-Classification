More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.  Professors include Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), and Andre Knoesen & Raj Amirtharajah (UC Davis).

Virtual toy building bricks take the place of traditional manipulatives, with studs on the surface representing numeric value.

The MathBRIX mission is to create new learning technologies that will make a significant social and economic impact over time. For the US to remain a world economic leader, all children must be able to think mathematically and problem-solve. Children behind in kindergarten, often stay behind through the remaining school years. Only 40% of U.S. fourth grade students are deemed proficient on national math assessments. Early intervention is key. The visual strategies are derived from the federally-funded Comprehensive School Mathematics Program. Twenty years of research found CSMP students had greater ability to solve novel math problems. CSMP was effective with the gifted as well as the learning challenged.
