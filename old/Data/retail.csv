With a focus on creating unique furniture showcasing international flavor, functional design, and sustainable materials, Arhaus furniture brightens any room with inspired decor. Arhaus designers search the world looking for eclectic designs and pieces to share with clients and customers at Arhaus locations, bringing back vivid furniture from master artisans. Arhaus was founded in 1986 by Jack Reed and his son John. The first store opened in downtown Cleveland as part of the Flats district in a building from the 1840s; thirty years later Arhaus now has locations in over 25 states. The store’s name was inspired by the Danish city Aarhus; after seeing the name, John Reed found a variation that conveyed an international feeling, combining his original inspiration with the German word for house. Jack Reed had a vision of a company that would sell unique products sourced from all over the world. Arhaus has partnered with vendors for over twenty years to ensure quality and consistency; vendors become more than just business partners, they become friends and family as both businesses expand. CEO John Reed says, “as we grow, they grow.” Arhaus works with vendors across the world to find handcrafted one-of-a-kind products. Amish-Americans in Ohio dry wood for years to create the Live Edge collection; iron artisans in Mexico forge iron frames for bar stools by hand. Arhaus buys directly from manufacturers who share the Arhaus vision for quality, design, and sustainability. Since the beginning of the company Arhaus has been committed to sustainability, and today Arhaus demonstrates those values through a philanthropic partnership with American Forests. Arhaus has never used wood from endangered forests in their furniture–all of the wood used today is sustainably sourced or recycled.

In a world dominated by cookie-cutter clones the evil forces of McFashion spread it’s awful agenda throughout the universe. The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent. This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand...something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse! The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since! It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You'll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord... and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason...cause you had their back. Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture.... Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment! Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful! Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com.

Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty point’s clearinghouse that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy efficient marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. Rewards.com was spun off from DBG Loyalty in Dallas, a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. The startup includes the executive leadership and mature platform from the parent company. The platform is solid and proven, with 10k registered users, over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and many more. Revenue is generated each time someone makes a purchase on a merchant site. The merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com. They also provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site, is a market first. URL: www.Rewards.com  Industry: Loyalty Points Clearinghouse  What: Consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient marketplace  Beta Launch: June 2017  Current Situation: Platform is built and already has 10k active users; over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, CBS, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and more.  PROBLEM IN THE MARKET Customers have an average of 29 loyalty programs per. Redeeming is a nightmare.  Customers are tired of too many programs and not enough reward. SOLUTION Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty points clearing house that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient clearinghouse marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. The company was spun out of a 15-year old loyalty database marketing company (DBG Loyalty located in Dallas) who is a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. WHY NOW? Coalitions are highly successful in other countries and have been for many years.  The timing is right for the United States and Rewards.com is the right opportunity because it is credit card, bank, and retailer neutral, giving it an edge in forming partnerships with coalition members. MARKET SIZE $291 billion ecommerce industry in the US. (*IBIS World) The Rewards.com Marketplace literally allows a shopper to purchase anything. Electronics, Department Stores, Travel, Office Supplies, Gift Cards, and Home goods are among the most popular categories. Shoppers of all ages, races, and incomes have increasingly more expectations of lower prices combined with a higher value. Rewards Marketplace is the solution for both, giving the Rewards Marketplace an edge over singular businesses that depend on either a low-cost or high-value strategies. The target market includes shoppers who are making purchases online or through a mobile device or tablet, as well as at in-store. Our goal is to identify profitable customers and their purchase patterns, and reward desirable behavior accordingly. Truly giving insight and understanding to behavior loyalty. BUSINESS MODEL Breakage and float are two strategic parts of gift cards and point redemptions. The value of unredeemed points and unused gift cards has significant value. Rewards.com sells points as part of their service offering to marketplace members, and breakage has accrued value. Ultimately Rewards wins if a shopper redeems their point because essentially they just made another purchase that is subject to retailer commission. In addition, revenue is derived from: •	Merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com for customers and provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. •	Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. •	Revenue from “Featured Advertising” and product placement •	Revenue from Email promotions to the Rewards.com customer database TECHNOLOGY •	Scalable software architecture with the flexibility to dynamically target customers and feature partners. •	Easy for customers to use and gain valuable shopping experiences with the incentives for the masses. COMPETITION Ebates.com is a cash-back model. Although hugely successful they struggle with shopper engagement and retaining shoppers year-after-year. Churn is high and engagement is low. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site is a market first. •	Mature and proven technology platform is live •	Seasoned executives who innovated loyalty programs for American Airlines, American Express, IHG and more. •	Estimated customer base 30mm •	Signed strategic partnerships MARKETING PLAN With a $3m raise, $2m will be spent reaching two goals. •	The first goal is to reach 105k active subscribers to reach $7m in revenue. •	The second goal is to reach 180k active subscribers to reach critical mass. FUNDRAISING 2016 – Raised $750,000 in Friends and Family 2017 – Raising $3m on a $12m valuation, Class A shares, with a 5% Dividend USE OF FUNDS Mainly digital marketing in the form of extensive retargeting, content marketing, PPC, social media influencer outreach, email marketing, Public Relations, etc. FOUNDING TEAM Todd Rowan, CEO Todd is the founder and CEO.

Recently, we've partnered with the American Diabetes Association to help families make the best decisions possible about the food they consume. Today Americans face the risk of diabetes and obesity on an alarming scale, due in large part to irresponsible practices of the food industry. At Peeled Snacks, we promote healthy eating habits as well as strive to use the most environmentally sustainable business practices. We source only organic ingredients and try to buy from local farmers and growers whenever possible. For our product display cases, we use recycled paper.

Trusted by 26,000+ retailers.","TaxCloud is an internet-based sales tax compliance service that is free for retailers because the company is paid by the states as a Certified Service Provider to many state Revenue Departments.  TaxCloud automatically keeps track of how things are taxed differently across all the states, automatically recognizes sales tax holidays, integrates easily with shopping carts and ordering systems, and helps online retailers instantly calculate, collect and remit sales tax.  With TaxCloud, even the smallest of businesses can easily manage sales tax in one state or all states - at no cost.  Perhaps more important than the free price tag, is the fact that TaxCloud has already been certified by many the states, which provides the retailers significantly reduced compliance risk (via indemnification, limitation of liability, and audit relief). In such an environment businesses need a trusted and stable compliance partner capable of easily handling their current obligations, but also a solution that can scale to handle any additional obligations they may have in the future. TaxCloud is trusted by more than 26,000 online retailers every day (and adding more every day). Our mission and message is simple: We believe no retailer should have to pay to comply with sales tax obligations because most jurisdictions are eager to ensure their sales taxes are collected correctly and remitted timely. By shifting the efforts of compliance back upon the states, TaxCloud has inverted the traditional tax technology marketplace, making sales tax compliance easy (and even free) for retailers of any size. With more than 26,000 merchants on board, we have proven this business model works in the US, and we are now developing plans to expand our footprint of operations to non-US jurisdictions.",,,http://twitter.com/TaxCloud,http://www.facebook.com/TaxCloud,"61,041"
