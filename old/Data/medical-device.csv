Seno Medical Instruments,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/seno-medical-instruments-inc,http://senomedical.com,"Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Medical Device",Health Care,Seno Medical is commercialization efforts in opto-acoustic imaging of breast cancer.,"Seno Medical was formed to commercialize a new modality in cancer screening and diagnosis: opto-acoustic imaging. Unlike most screening techniques, which rely on anatomical imaging, Seno's goal is to bring functional imaging that can detect angiogenesis to the marketplace. Their first product is a small animal imaging device. This product application was successfully licensed to a world market leader, VisualSonics. Products for use with humans, focusing initially on breast cancer, are also in development. Seno’s first clinical application is for breast cancer diagnosis. A strong, experienced management team and nationally recognized Scientific Advisory Board have been assembled to complete the commercialization, secure regulatory approval and launch the products. The management team has a long history of working together and in successfully commercializing medical devices. Seno’s patented technology integrates the use of lasers and acoustics to determine the presence of angiogenesis—the growth of blood vessels and higher blood volume that always surrounds a tumor. This represents a significant evolutionary step in imaging. Unlike anatomical imaging techniques, such as mammography, laser opto-acoustic imaging can detect breast cancer, for example, at its earliest clinically significant stage (2 mm. versus 10 mm. with mammography) without patient discomfort or exposure to harmful x-ray. The opportunities are exciting…for investors and scientists, for physicians and the myriad women and men tested for or diagnosed with cancer each year. The goal of laser opto-acoustic imaging is to allow more precise and earlier detection of smaller tumors and the ability to differentiate benign from malignant growth without biopsy. Future applications will focus on other types of cancer and broader diagnostic and treatment applications. Seno acquired working pre-prototypes in addition to the core patents on opto-acoustic technology; they will license two other patents for future applications. These patents constitute a platform technology with a multitude of potential follow-on applications, including imaging for the earliest detection of cancer of the ovary, bladder, prostate, colon and melanoma as well as unstable plaque (cardiovascular). Peer review and the continued funding of $13 million from nationally recognized institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Department of Defense (DoD) support their scientific credibility. And, significantly, the pre-prototypes being used in clinical testing have demonstrated a strong correlation to biopsy in diagnosing cancer. They look forward to the future and to the role Seno can play in minimizing the uncertainty, the cost and trauma of diagnosing and treating cancer.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/seno-medical-instruments,,https://twitter.com/senomedical,https://www.facebook.com/senomedicalinstruments/,"27,634"

They receive remote updates on almost all information critical to their lives and lifestyle, and they have the ability to monitor event status and to predict and plan for change. Yet in the medical field, a physician treating a progressive disease often has no choice but to be reactive -- often with harmful results. Critical data on patient disease state is collected infrequently during sporadic office visits, yielding only a single data point to interpret past trends and assess long-term risk. Unlike their personal updates, continously available via sensors, GIS, and smart phone connectivity, there is no continuous stream of physiological measurement data from patients that can allow physicians to track and anticipate changes in disease status. The medical team cannot see how patient activity may be affecting disease indicators, and they can't see whether patients are even complying with drug therapy. The end result? More patient visits to the ER and doctor's office -- often when physiological damage has already been done. Injectsense: A New Paradigm for Therapy Management Injectsense enables tracking of progressive disease indicators and improved therapy management by providing continuous, clinically actionable information through an injectable ultra-miniature sensor coupled with a secure digital health platform.

Its first commercial application will be as a more reliable means of vascular access for dialysis patients, with a subsequent application to treat peripheral artery disease.  We have great results in multiple controlled animal studies, a large patent portfolio, established production capacity, and are ready to begin human studies later this year in preparation for market launch. Near-Term Problem / Market Opportunity:  Vascular Access for Dialysis Kidney failure patients need to have their blood filtered 3 times per week via dialysis.  This removes waste from the blood, which would otherwise cause them to die.  However, current methods for repeatedly accessing the bloodstream for dialysis are unreliable.  This problem is a huge contributor to the $50 billion per year that the U.S. spends on dialysis patients (7% of Medicare’s entire budget!).  A vascular graft is often implanted under the skin (connecting an artery to a vein) to create an access site with sufficient bloodflow for dialysis -- but existing grafts tend to occlude quickly, requiring repeated expensive interventions to keep them open. Solution:  STARgraft Because our vascular graft remains open to blood flow much longer than existing grafts, it can potentially satisfy a severe unmet clinical need for ready-to-use, safe, long-term dialysis access, while substantially reducing costs, illness and death rate among dialysis patients. Product Pipeline We have additional products in development, including an implantable port which will allow needle-free dialysis.  Eliminating the use of needles would further reduce cost and illness among dialysis patients, and allow them to perform dialysis in the convenience of their own home.  In addition, our platform STAR biomaterial can improve the performance of a wide range of implantable devices via its remarkable ability to prevent both infection and scar tissue.

Lotz and Bradford at, and exclusively licensed from, UC San Francisco. The extensive experience and cross-functional backgrounds of these co-founders merge for the second time with Nocimed, which follows another disruptive new spine therapy company also previously co-founded and successfully launched under their combined leadership. This same consortium provides the foundation for Nocimed's on-going direction and execution, which has already successfully achieved many significant milestones.  The company has conducted its operations since early 2008 on over $3.5 million dollars of Series A Preferred financing.  This was raised via private placement “Angel” investments via accredited investors, including from each of the company’s founders and a long list of world renowned thought leaders in spine surgery, pain management, and imaging/radiology.  The company's direction and management continue to be led by its co-founders, and via an expanded team of management and operational professionals - and other consultants - adding further significant experience and acumen in engineering, sales & marketing, reimbursement, and regulatory/quality/clinical affairs relevant to the company's field.  The company already achieved many significant development milestones for its primary first investigational product, NociscanTM, involving multiple inventions captured in intellectual property owned by the Company. The company initially sponsored a $1MM/2 year co-development program at UCSF from early 2008 to early 2010.  This principally featured feasibility clinical studies to initially develop the technology for use with one initial commercially available high field MR system for robustly acquired and post-processed in vivo MRS data, and to train a diagnostic algorithm based on that MRS data which correlates highly to pain and degeneration per other standard diagnostic controls (e.g. including invasive discogram for pain).  The data from this initial investigational clinical development study demonstrated high procedural success for the Nociscan MRS diagnostic platform, with extremely high diagnostic accuracy against standard controls for diagnosing discs as painful vs. non-painful, and was the subject of multiple podium presentations in various medical and scientific society venues.  Nocimed's more recent activities and objectives have been to advance Nociscan in next investigational development steps from the successful initial development and feasibility experience enjoyed at UC San Francisco.  This has principally involved development for cross-platform use via multiple different MR system platforms from different manufacturers, and while gathering more clinical data for assessing correlations and algorithm training.  The company plans to complete this development under an on-going multi-platform, multi-center study that was IRB approved in October 2011 and launched on a first platform (Siemens 3T Verio) in November 2011.  While Nociscan is being developed and evaluated for compatible use with various MR systems from multiple manufacturers, the company is using the current study and conducting concurrent negotiations to evaluate which MR system(s) will be chosen for advancement for future trials, regulatory pathways, and ultimate planned commercialization in the future.  Upon successful completion of this study, the company plans to freeze the platform design for a first generation planned product offering, and conduct a prospective, multi-center trial to further confirm the robustness of the uses intended for regulatory clearance of the platform.  These latter activities are likely to be conducted via a multi-$ million dollar Series B Preferred financing that the company plans to conduct by mid-2011.",,,,,"38,112"
