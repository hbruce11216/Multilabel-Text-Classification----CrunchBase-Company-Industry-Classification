Our philosophy is simple: An  enjoyable travel experience does not involve carrying or checking your luggage.   A great vacation does not begin at the baggage carousel, or worse yet, with lost or late arriving  luggage or sports equipment. In 2004, two guys who had met in high school and spent their share of time schlepping bags through airports set out to fundamentally change the way people travel.  Luggage Forward has since grown to become the leading provider of door-to-door luggage and sports equipment delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.   Offering a range of specialized options allowing clients the convenience of traveling without their bags, Luggage Forward has multiple services and price points to fit the requirements of almost any itinerary.  The company has pioneered a straightforward process of forwarding luggage by leveraging proprietary technology as well as trusted relationships with a comprehensive network of agents and shippers, resulting in unparalleled reliability. Luggage Forward’s industry-leading set of online tools allows clients to generate pricing, securely book online and track luggage real-time.  Powered by the proprietary Automated Routing Control™ system, the Luggage Forward website is able to instantly identify the most reliable, convenient and cost-effective method of shipment for each individual booking. Beginning in 2009, Luggage Forward embarked on a strategy of consolidation of the then-fragmented luggage shipping industry. Ultimately, seven different brands have been acquired so far. The combined industry experience of these companies approaches 50 years.

D’Isernia. As the owner of a fleet of commercial fishing vessels, Mr. D’Isernia ventured into the world of shipbuilding after learning first hand that the only way to get the type of vessels he wanted was to design the vessels, write the specifications, and build them himself. As he built and developed his own personal fleet of vessels, other professionals in the industry took notice and also began desiring their own custom built vessels. Soon customers in areas including New England, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska were contacting Eastern with requests for customized fishing vessels. By 1980, 26 commercial fishing vessels had been constructed and delivered. Building on his passion for boats and the sea, Mr. D’Isernia decided to diversify Eastern’s reputation from a ‘Fishing Vessel’ shipyard into a shipyard that could fulfill any type of custom vessel request, large or small. In 1981, Eastern’s diversification began with the delivery of their first Offshore Supply Vessels. Today, Eastern’s history includes a portfolio of over 350 vessels and Eastern is one of the most diverse vessel construction companies as a result of its state of the art production line and fabrication process. Eastern has built everything from Offshore Supply Vessels to Tugs, ATB’s, Inland Towboats, a SWATH Vessel, Passenger Vessels, Ro-Ro/Passenger Ferries, Inland Transport Vessels, Barges, Fireboats, Research Vessels, Offshore Construction Vessels, Dredges, High Speed Passenger Vessels, Fishing Vessels, and more.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/EasternSG/,"271,554"

Initially founded at a time of chronic air traffic delays and mounting customer dissatisfaction about airline service in general, including baggage handling. Today, while both the delays and the complaints have plunged along with airline traffic, the tighter security and increased baggage fees have bolstered the incentive for some travelers to have someone else handle their luggage. In 2004 Jeff Boyd became president of Luggage Free and the number of bags the company shipped doubled each year from 2004 to 2007, with shipments reaching around 40,000 in 2007. Luggage Free cooperates with a network of agents and carriers to retrieve luggage from a client’s location at a specific time, insure them and then wraps the luggage in plastic protective packaging. Luggage Free prices by the weight and dimensions of the shipment. The overwhelming success of Luggage Free can be attributed to the White Glove treatment, which protects travelers from lost luggage, check-in and baggage claim wait-time at the airport as well as weight restrictions; the difference is evident from the moment you pick up the phone. With over 41 million complaints of lost luggage by airline passengers in 2011, Luggage Free continues to grow in over 140 countries worldwide.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/luggage-free,,http://twitter.com/luggagefree,http://www.facebook.com/LuggageFree,"311,113"

Why did you have to stand in line at the shipping store just to put a label on? With that, the idea for ZipShipit was born. Not only did we want to make things convenient for the shipper, but we also wanted to give you control over which carrier you used as well as how much you paid. So now with ZipShipit you can compare prices from multiple carriers like UPS & USPS (Other carriers to be added soon) to find the most economical price. However, no matter which carrier you choose, you will still get a lower rate than at the local shipping store or post office. Therefore, after months of negotiating with UPS & USPS on your behalf, you can now ship from the comfort and convenience of your own home or business for rates up to 40% less than the shipping stores or post office.",,,https://www.twitter.com/zipshipit,https://www.facebook.com/zipshipit,"476,218"
Discreet Drop,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discreet-drop,https://discreetdrop.com/,"E-Commerce, Shipping, Shopping","Commerce and Shopping, Transportation","Guarantee discreet shipping on any package, from any seller.","Discreet Drop is a Buffalo-based startup founded in 2017 by Kevin Skompinski, serving to create a way to make sure that every item people order can arrive to them as discreet as possible. Privacy has become a pseudo-luxury in today's digital age, with any information being available just a simple search way. We've identified this gap in privacy protection with all the information and identifiable logos a shipped box provides to anyone who may see it. Logos, packing slips, and customs forms are obvious clues as to the contents of a package. Even merchants who advertise discreet shipping still have a return label on their packages which lists the seller's name and address; both of which can be quickly Googled to reveal what's in any package. We've realized that if you're not handling your package at all times, your privacy is vulnerable on any shipment. Only the recipient should know what's in their package. With this in mind, we've created Discreet Drop as a solution to cover up those privacy issues, literally. We serve as a shipment processor, where people can ship their packages to us via a unique address, from any online store. We then double-box the package to cover up any external logos, return labels, packing slips, and even holes; anything that can act as identifying information and can be used to signal what's in the box. Finally we ship the plain-box out to the customer so it will arrive completely discreet, and nobody but the customer would be able to figure out what's in the package. Easy. With Discreet Drop, packages will arrive with no logos or branding to attract attention from anyone, reveal the contents of the box, and won't have any identifying information that can be used to figure out is in a package. With Discreet Drop, only the customer will ever know what is in their packages. Discreet Drop is the only way to guarantee 100% discreet shipping on any package, from any seller.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-skompinski-68b4231a,,https://twitter.com/DiscreetDrop,https://www.facebook.com/DiscreetDrop/,"476,756"
