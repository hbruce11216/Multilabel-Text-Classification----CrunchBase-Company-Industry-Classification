Shippers and carriers too often have come to settle for less when it comes to their supply chain partners. Our carriers receive an unprecedented amount of financial and technological support, allowing us to provide our shipping partners with exceptional service and capacity.

Curb connects you to safe, reliable rides from the professional taxi and for-hire drivers nationwide. By bringing technology to the taxi and sedan experience, Curb is offering riders choice, reliability, and convenience whenever they ride.  Curb’s story is told in three parts. Curb began in 2007 as RideCharge, an online service for business travelers to manage the booking and expensing of taxi rides and other local ground transportation. It soon developed a broader consumer focus, hastened by the adoption of smartphone technology. In our second iteration, Curb was Taxi Magic, the first mobile app for ordering a ride, on-demand. After Apple introduced the App Store as a distribution platform for consumer apps, we built Taxi Magic upon our existing technology and released it in January 2009. Over the next five years, we built a nationwide network of riders, drivers, and taxi companies. In that time, our technology-powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers. In August 2014, Taxi Magic became a Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere. All rides begin and end at the curb, and our technology improves the entire experience from curb to curb by eradicating underlying pain points and making ground travel seamless and hassle-free.  Now, Curb is consistently ranked in the Top 50 for “Travel & Tourism” in the App Store and the Android Marketplace. In addition, we have built the Curb Passenger Information Monitor (PIM) that supports credit card payment and entertaining video content. The Curb Network consists of 35,000 taxis with 90 fleets in 60 US cities. By aligning riders, drivers, and fleets, Curb offers a better overall ride experience.

Facing a heavy post-war migration to the area and its consequent automobile boom, these people discussed ways of easing the mounting congestion that was clogging the bridges spanning the Bay. In 1947, a joint Army-Navy review Board concluded that another connecting link between San Francisco and Oakland would be needed in the years ahead to prevent intolerable congestion on the Bay Bridge. The link? An underwater tube devoted exclusively to high-speed electric trains. Since 1911, visionaries had periodically brought up this Jules Verne concept. But now, pressure for a traffic solution increased with the population. In 1951, the State Legislature created the 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay.

EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown.

RelGen captures the spinning force of the vehicle’s drive shaft through a custom center bearing. A belt transmits this kinetic energy to an alternator where it is converted into electricity. It is stored for later use to power almost any accessory – like electric APU’s, liftgates, autonomous truck sensors, cameras. The technology benefits heavy commercial truck fleets that utilize battery power for accessories. Long-haul drivers need cab climate systems to live and work comfortably. Fleets whose drivers use liftgates to deliver products and services need battery power too.  RelGen is the fastest charging system on the market and allows users to reduce fuel and maintenance costs related to engine idling and helps fleets increase uptime and profits while eliminating tonnes of CO2 per truck per year. The Energy and Combustion Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Lowell analyzed our data from customer trucks to assess fuel savings and emissions reductions. Their results confirm our industry value: One Year ROI, eliminates engine idle on trucks with liftgates saves 3-5 gallons of diesel per day resulting in $3,000 saved per truck per year.

Optimus Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/optimus-technologies,http://www.optimustec.com/,"Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, Transportation, Waste Management","Energy, Manufacturing, Sustainability, Transportation",Optimus Technologies is the market leader in EPA compliant biodiesel conversion systems for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.,"Optimus Technologies® designs and builds patented EPA compliant biodiesel conversion systems (“Vector Systems”) with integrated telematics to allow medium and heavy-duty trucks to operate on up to 100% biodiesel in temperatures to -20°F.  Our system is deployable within 30 days providing North American trucking fleets with the lowest cost, highest return, barrier free alternative fuel system available, allowing them a significant return on investment while achieving sustainability targets.  By partnering with major industry players to leverage their capabilities, Optimus will deliver a fully integrated client solution that is rapidly scalable, creating a $279MM company by 2023. MARKET OPPORTUNITY In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.   Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.   WHY INVEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES:  We are the most competitive alternative fuel system available.  Directly competing technologies such as CNG, and the emerging segment of electric trucks have high barriers to entry including long lead times, high technology and infrastructure costs, and limitations on long-haul adaptability. Our infrastructure costs are at most, 10% of competing technologies.  Our integrated solution is rapidly scalable, integrating seamlessly with existing equipment and infrastructure and our range equates to and can exceed diesel technology.  Competitive advantage increases in relation to weight class, with Optimus easily bypassing all heavy-duty competitors.   *  Only Fully Integrate Alternative Fuel Solution:  Fuel System, Fuel, Fueling Infrastructure *  Lowest Cost Alternative Fuel System:  $12,000 Fully Installed *  Guaranteed  Annual Cost Savings - $8,000/year/truck *  Rapidly Deployable: 30 days *  Achieves Sustainability Targets:  GHG Emission Credit: 60-100%, Particulate Matter Reduction 40% *  DPF Operating System Improvement - Improves Efficiency *  Fuel Infrastructure Solved *  Simple Maintenance - Fully Automated  *  Available for New and Used Vehicles PROVEN MANAGEMENT TEAM - Extensive experience across the transportation, renewable fuels, software and engineering sectors from start-up to leading industry players.  Multiple successes founding, financing, scaling, managing, and exiting companies. PATENTED, PROVEN TECHNOLOGY - 4 patents (2 approved and 2 pending) and extensive IP surrounding proprietary engine systems’ control software. We believe our system to be the only EPA compliant biodiesel conversion system available for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  The Vector System is a proven technology in early stages of commercialization, backed by five years of research and seven years of pilot testing and development.  LEVERAGE SUSTAINABILITY & REGULATION – There is a large and growing demand for alternatives to gasoline and diesel that is driven by regulation as well as public and private sector interest in reducing carbon and NOx emissions.  The Company’s profitability and customer value proposition is not dependent upon these incentives, but we will leverage these multiple state, provincial, US and Canadian policies to further support expansion.   Optimus’ system has been approved for the Government of Quebec’s Programme Ecocamionnage, providing a 30% rebate on the installed cost of the system.  Similar provincial incentives will be pursued across Canada. ONLY APPROVED PATHWAY FOR HIGH BIODIESEL BLENDS UP TO B100 IN CALIFORNIA – Leveraging our RFID system to meet California fuel control requirements, Optimus’ core technology combined with our RFID fuel management system will provide our investors, distributors, and fuel partners a 2-3 year first mover advantage in California. SUPPORT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING & JOB CREATION – Optimus will directly create over 200 new jobs and 100% of our components are sourced from US manufacturers and suppliers. INVESTOR VALUE CREATION – $199-$279MM valuation by 2023 (5-7x EBITDA), on $12.8MM total invested capital, yielding 16-22x total investment.

Problem:  Although carriers with fleets of 20 trucks or less make up over 92% of all trucking companies in the United States, they must compete with larger fleets without the benefit of the premium-priced software tools and economies of scale savings available to their more resourced competitors. Thus, many carriers juggle multiple software subscriptions and/or manual processes to carry out their day-to-day fleet and business operations. Synthesizing the various outputs from separate tools costs small business owners time and money that could be better utilized elsewhere. Solution: Truckish’s Fleet Management Solution saves carriers time and money by integrating the tools they need into a comprehensive SaaS system that is affordable to the average trucking company. These tools include dispatch, vehicle diagnostics, tracking and maintenance, ELD and Hours of Service compliance, IFTA calculations, contacts management, and accounting with easy integration to QuickBooks and payroll systems.  Carriers use the Truckish web platform to manage their customers, team, and assets. Our automated workflow seamlessly facilitates every load from dispatch through to invoicing and driver payroll. Drivers connect to the platform via the Truckish mobile app, where they monitor their assignments, track their hours of service, and manage load documentation and contacts. And with Truckish plug and play hardware installed in their trucks, carriers can view real time data and diagnostics on their vehicles while maintaining compliance with the latest government ELD mandate.

These vehicles fail to meet the practical needs of people running errands, shopping, commuting to work, riding with kids, or socializing with friends. Focused on these activities, we designed ROME from the ground up as the ideal blend of safety, utility, performance, and beauty. MARKET LANDSCAPE The experience of riding a bicycle is one that we all share, and nearly everyone loves. Still, too many city cyclists are dissatisfied with products that fail to meet their everyday needs. Confronted with many offerings, consumers have few meaningful choices. Most e-bike manufacturers focus on aggressively masculine or utilitarian styling, leaving riders practical and emotional needs largely undressed. Without useful innovation, these products alienate mainstream urbanites who perceive them as little more than expensive toys with a weak value proposition. OUR SOLUTION In this context, we introduce the ROME eMotorTrike. Our scalable platform blends the safety and utility of a traditional tricycle with the agility and ride-performance of a premium electric bike. Its timeless aesthetic speaks to millennials, boomers, urbanites, couples, and young families.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/lovaro-emotortrike,,,https://www.facebook.com/lovaroNYC/,"78,270"

You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community. RideMode See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie. Best Practices Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook. You can also block people within the My Community screen in RideConnect and this will prevent them from sharing rides with you but will not remove them from your community. Be safe. Drive safe. Ride safe. That's it. Start sharing rides.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/rideconnect-llc?trk=biz-companies-cym,,https://www.twitter.com/rideconnect,https://www.facebook.com/rideconnect,"107,717"

The aerodynamic sleek flowing lines make it the most striking of land or sea planes.  We have developed the world’s best and fastest 4/5 place amphibian. The spacious cabin, panoramic view, quiet environment, and form-fitting seats all combine to create total traveling comfort.  Since the dawn of aviation, designers have been trying to create a seaplane that would fly as fast and as far as a land plane and carry a reasonable useful load over a long distance.  Using advanced composite technology and innovative design, Seawind has accomplished that lofty goal. High speed stability is superb.  The standard slotted flaps and the swept back wingtip floats (sponsons) create an extraordinary ground effect, cushions the touchdown, and speeds the lift-off on water and land.  Low speed stability is excellent.  Never before has an amphibian offered so much comfort.  The Seawind has the widest cabin in its class, with the standard executive deluxe four-place configuration or the optional family five-place seating.  The seats are bucket-style adjustable with temper foam for ultimate comfort.  The special designed seats have passed the stringent 26g forward and 19g - 60°up vertical crash tests. The wrap-around windshield offers a spectacular panoramic view even for the aft seats. Whether the mission is a business meeting in the city or a fishing trip into the wilderness, or cross country travel, the Seawind fills the bill.  The Seawind is the only plane that fulfills every customer’s needs.",,,,,"109,416"

The result is easy, low cost adoption, and a “perpetual” revenue model based on usage fee for Summerhill.  This also solves the “bulk” of biomass problem and associated transportation issues Summerhill possesses the key to the symbiotic relationship between a deep understanding of the agricultural market and economic viability of powdered fuels in the biomass market. Safe and reliable. Waste and byproducts derived from materials such as Alfalfa, Cane, Citrus, Corn, Flax, Manure, Sewage, Sorghum, Switchgrass, and Wood can be leveraged to create storable fuel and energy. Powdered biomass can enhance efficiency of cellulose to ethanol and diodigester processes by using byproduct for heat recovery in operations. Further, it is well documented across many industries to be easily and safely transported. Efficiency: Summerhill methods recover high percentages of energy stored in biomass without use of complex fermentation processes, fertilizer, food crops, or cultivated land.  The Summerhill process is easily inserted in the farm/processor/storage hub model that is inherent to agriculture. While most economic commercialization timelines for cleantech and green technology are expected to be 15-20 years, investors, the U.S. government  and affiliates would like to see a reduced timeline of to three to five years.  Since Summerhill leverages existing assets and ways of doing business, the company is confident it can achieve commercialization with an attractive ROI on a three to five year schedule.

Saia's Core Values Customer First Doing what it takes, in everything we do, means putting the customer first. It doesn’t mean short-changing safety, policies or procedures, or respect, but it means understanding that fundamentally, our customers are at the heart of our business – in everything we do. Safety Safety is not a policy or procedure. Safety is a fundamental behavior and practice. It is the unified practice that we can efficiently and effectively all work safely and perform our functions to support individual employees and company goals. Taking Care of Each Other Teamwork, empathy, and giving 100 percent. Taking care of each other means leaders caring about employees, employees caring for each other and for customers, and everyone at Saia caring about the company's purpose and goals. Dignity and Respect Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Every employee at Saia has a sense of worth and value that they bring to their role at the company. We must all recognize the humanity in each other and treat others respectfully. Do the Right Thing Doing the right thing means making the conscientious choice, the ethical choice, even when no one is looking. Doing the right thing demands commitment to excellence and an awareness that why you do something can be as important as what you do. Community As a company and as a team of employees, we must embrace our responsibility to our neighbors, the environment, those with whom we work, and the communities that sustain us. We realize that it is always easy to talk about being a good citizen and yet it is another to put words into action. QUALITY MATTERS A concept often discussed but seldom defined. Not at Saia.

My revenue grows close to 50% year over year. Revenue growth has slowed as they need to expand to keep up with demand.  They have exhausted their cash expanding last year. One of the ways that car manufacturers ""fix"" their problems in cars today is with software updates. The equipment to properly diagnose and update today's cars is  prohibitively expensive to the vast majority of repair shops. They have the tools to provide those services to individual shops and dealers for most makes and model 1996 and newer. Their business in in the Washington DC suburbs and the growth potential is phenomenal not including the name, logo, and business possibly ripe for franchising. I have neither the experience or capital to consider that at this moment and would consider most opportunities.  They have many shops, an example would be similar to Carmax. They have many cars a day they send to the dealer to get diagnosed. They are limited to what they can do in a parking lot out of a van and are looking to open a fixed location repair shop that would do the same thing Scan Man presently does with the addition of complete auto repair. Scan Man is my second successful business start up and the other was a repair shop. I personally consider success extremely likely in this market. The possibilities for the mobile operation alone can far exceed $2,000,000/year once fully expanded. They only do a tiny fraction of the VA suburbs, full expansion would be the DC area and the MD suburbs. The average household income in this market is approximately $120,000/year.
