I changed my sleep schedule. I started biking to work. Nothing moved the needle. Finally, I discovered the high-healthy-fat, low-net-carb diet by reading (and re-reading) works by Dr. David Perlmutter, Dr. Mark Hyman, Gary Taubes, and other proponents of the regimen. Within weeks of trading bread and pasta for nuts and avocados, my cognitive energy and performance staged a remarkable rebound! Astonished by the impact food had on my mental acuity, I vowed to share my experience with millions of others struggling to stay sharp. The best way to do this - I decided - was to formulate and democratize “brain fuel” myself. I set off on a year-long journey to create snacks that were both high-fat/low-carb and packed with nutrients shown to promote brain function and health.

At the time, both had corporate jobs, were training for a 24-hour obstacle race, and were running a group fitness company. Because of their busy schedules and drive to succeed, sleep became less important to them. In order to be their best, they needed something that could give them a quick jolt of energy. At first, they would drink anything that would keep them awake. As former college students, they started with what they knew - energy drinks. They quickly found that this was an extremely unhealthy option and one that would leave them with a hard crash once the sugar wore off. As they looked further into what was actually in these products they were disgusted at the amount of sugar and synthetic ingredients they were consuming. So, like any corporate employee would do, they turned to their trusty friend, coffee.  Every morning they would wake up 15 minutes early just to brew a pot of drip coffee, but just like everything else they tried, it had several drawbacks. The coffee took way too long to brew, produced a terrible tasting product, and wasn't convenient to take with them. Three things that in their mind were unacceptable. In the summer of 2012  they stumbled upon cold brew coffee. It fulfilled all of their requirements for the perfect source of energy, it was natural, sugar-free, and simple, but there was one very significant drawback, it wasn't at all convenient. To make it on their own took them 24 hours and if they wanted to buy it they had to wait in-line at a coffee shop. Over the next several years their love for cold brew grew, and so did their frustration with its lack of convenience and availability. They spent the next 2-years researching a way to create the highest quality product, in the most convenient way, and in 2015 they launched Bizzy - the healthiest and most convenient coffee on the market.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-bizzy-inc-,,https://twitter.com/bizzycoffee,https://www.facebook.com/BizzyCoffee,"50,082"
