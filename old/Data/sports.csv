Fantasy sports and sports betting have been the only options for users seeking to profit from their sports knowledge. Both platforms suffer from costly inefficiencies, yield low-to-negative average returns on investment, and feature few long-term winners. What if you could trade teams like stocks? After years of studying the economic incentives, infrastructure, and esoteric instruments of the sports gambling ecosystem, we concluded that a more intuitive, democratic, exchange-oriented system had to be established outside of the ways and means of the sportsbooks. What ensued was Fanvest’s vision for a new way to invest in sports. Robinhood meets Draftkings We’ve replaced bookies and the house with you, the Fanvestor and the power of markets. Like your favorite chef, we use only the best ingredients in crafting the future of sports investment. We like to keep the recipe simple: {Fantasy Sports} + {Sports Betting} — {Fees & Expenses} + {Markets & Trading} = Fanvest’s stock market of sports. The unpaid Fanvest team is a diverse group of creatives, data nerds, sports fanatics, recovering bankers, investors, engineers, writers, designers, and tech enthusiasts with enough crazy in us to commit our lives to building Fanvest’s stock market of sports ecosystem. After years of research, beta releases, iterating, tinkering, improving, and tweaking, there is nothing that will stop us from bringing our fully-baked vision to market… This space has over 60 million fantasy sports players in North America and an estimated $30B addressable sports betting market. With your engagement, we will pave the way for an alternative, new, and more democratic offering that removes the bookmakers and their complicated and costly systems, while offering a complimentary product to traditional and daily fantasy sports. Isn’t it about time you got a platform you deserved? A platform that allowed you to monetize your sports knowledge and maximize your fandom without losing your wallet? Aren’t you tired of losing? Tired of overpaying for vigs, tournaments, and other expenses only to find yourself in the red? Whether you are a sports fan, a fantasy pro, a sports bettor, or just a curious person, we want you to know that we want to hear from you.

On the other hand, lemonade represents sweet and tasty drink which is loved in the U.S. Therefore, a direct translation of this clause is ""Let's make lemonade when someone hands you a trouble"". Namely, even if you face a trouble (lemon), you could try to achieve the fruit (lemonade) out of it. They love this clause. They love a positive attitude to try to convert a trouble into a success.

Teaching coursework on entrepreneurship and accounting to up-and-coming business professionals, Rob was challenged by a student who wondered whether bulletproof armor could be made lighter and more flexible. After many years of research and over $10 million dollars in funding, the answer is UNEQUAL, a revolutionary composite that promises to reduce the pain and injury associated with impacts. The multilayer product was originally developed for military applications, and was tested under incredibly stringent guidelines issued by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the organization that certifies bullet-resistant armor. UNEQUAL’s unique composite material, fortified with DuPont Kevlar® aramid fibers, works by stopping bullets and dispersing the impact energy of projectiles, helping the wearer to remain safe. The shock-blocking technology served to protect the wearer from impact injuries and bullet wounds sustained on the battlefield, and was adopted by soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and government agents. The technology behind these innovative products is backed by over 85 U.S. and international patents and extensive testing from independent, accredited laboratories the world over. OEM facilities and university science programs have verified the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing protective gear. The product was soon applied to the task of protecting those involved in professional sports. It first found favor in pro sports among NFL players, who flocked to the company’s protective wear. Now, the protective products can be found in body armor and helmet padding among dozens of players in the football league, and other sports governing bodies like the NHL and Major League Baseball have begun to use the products to help protect players. For action sports like the X Games, the lightweight protective products are ideal in that they protect against injuries while remaining flexible and easy to wear, even in extreme conditions. The protective head and body gear is vastly superior to other protective products on the market, especially those constructed of plastic and foam. The layered composite material in UNEQUAL’s protective product line is tough and resilient, able to withstand the abuse that collision and action sports can create. Collegiate and youth athletes in disciplines like baseball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, and football can benefit from the protection UNEQUAL’s products provide. Products are designed to be affordable and can be customized for specific sporting applications and body types, giving the athlete tremendous flexibility while warding off the injuries and pain associated with sports impacts. UNEQUAL and its products have received several prominent awards for innovation in the field of protective sportswear. The company was recognized by Forbes as one of the magazine’s 100 Most Promising Companies. Thanks to our work with DuPont, the manufacturing company presented UNEQUAL with its Kevlar® Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, Esquire, ESPN, and Inc. Magazine all listed the company and its products among the most important tech innovations for the year. The industry publication Composites Manufacturing called the company “The Industry’s Best” that same year, showcasing the protective gear’s growth from military origins to sporting applications and its future in protecting actors in movie and television productions, among many other roles.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/unequal-technologies-company,,https://twitter.com/unequaltech,https://www.facebook.com/UnequalTech,"43,278"

And through the years, they’ve remained true to these roots. I first met Carlo in the winter of 2005. When not working as a materials engineer, he raced for fun and tapped his extensive experience with carbon fiber to develop his own ski equipment. As someone who constantly tinkered with his own gear, I was intrigued by Carlo’s work. Consequently, they quickly became friends and began collaborating on prototypes. Soon, some of the best skiers in the world began sporting his shinguards. And within a year of working together, I was able to take these products to the top of the Olympic podium. From this momentum and thirst for innovation, Slytech Protection was born. Immediately, they began turning heads. Yet their vision transcended the race course. I was part of a new generation of skiers who raced but didn’t wish to be defined or constrained by it. They loved hitting the park, slashing pow turns, and hucking cliffs. Like many of my friends, I was just as influenced by freeskiing and snowboarding as I was by racing. Consequently, Carlo and I aimed to embrace and unite all snowsports. At the time, this approach was as unique as it was raw. In the fall of 2006, they debuted Shred Optics. As with Slytech, their plans were simple. They wanted to develop products that looked as good as they performed—and not just on the race course, but also in the park and backcountry. Their inaugural collection consisted of a single goggle frame, available in a healthy dose of neon. Iconic, original, loud—whatever you called them, their goggles were visible from across the valley. About this same time, they also launched the first soft back protector with Slytech, which was soon worn by top freeskiers, snowboarders, and racers. With hustle and grit, they worked to further refine their vision for Shred and Slytech. When not slaving away over R&D inside a garage, Carlo hijacked a corner of his father’s office in Venice, Italy for their global headquarters. Meanwhile, they ran their US operations out of my attic in Park City, enlisting their friends as sales reps. They didn’t have a business plan, but they had plenty of ambition. Today, they have a few more products to their name, but their commitment to innovation is stronger than ever. Whether developing helmets, back protectors, sunglasses, or goggles, they’re pioneering fresh technology and emerging as a market leader—while proudly maintaining their status as underdogs. By blending performance and style, Slytech and Shred help you have fun, stay safe, and push your limits. And ten years in, they’re still building the products of their dreams.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/SHREDoptics/,"63,839"

The Football Platform's most innovative feature is our Free Agency Auction software, which facilitates up to 32 fantasy owners to simulate NFL Free Agency over the course of 3-4 hours instead of 3-4 months. During the Free Agency Auction, the owners build their respective teams by negotiating with and signing players to single and/or multi-year contracts in real-time online. An algorithm thinks and acts as the Player's Agent/Player Intelligence, instantaneously fielding and valuing offers of various lengths and amount (see image below of the Free Agency Auction Room).

An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him “do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By 1958, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today. Ed Stack, Dick’s son, is the current CEO and Chairman of DICK’S Sporting Goods. He and his siblings bought the store from their father and are responsible for taking two stores and growing the chain to over 500 stores.

They don’t just throw that on as a tag line to seem cool. They live it. Their cardio equipment, weights, yoga studio, and fitness class room is on the first floor because they believe in the full integration of fitness. It’s not on the top story, tucked away in some back corner, isolated from the main area. It’s front and center. They know your training and health requires more than just climbing. They have trainers and staff to help with that wholistic approach to your well being. But that’s only part of the story. They strive for something greater than perfection. If you feel something is perfect, you become complacent, stagnant. Ingenuity is lost. Progress is lost. They strive for something different – they strive for constant improvement. When they open – this will be the best gym you’ve ever seen. And then, they’ll make it better. Not once, but constantly. Incessantly. It’s what drives us. And how will they achieve this? Community. While that is the most used buzzword in their industry, they walk that talk very differently than other gyms. Their community is intentional and visible – in their philosophy on how they hire, treat, and retain employees, in how they designed their space, in how they engage with you the customer, and in how they give back to the outdoor climbing areas surrounding us.

It'll be the foundation that holds us together as we look to accomplish huge goals in the years to come. The concept of living in ""professional"" and ""personal"" silos has always been a foreign concept and even beyond evo, it seems to be more an idea rather than reality. The fact is what you do for work is very personal. It's where you spend many of your waking hours and the relationships with those you work with day in, day out are far too important to be cordoned off from personal life. Over the years, friends, families, traveling and mountain partners, dinner eating and beer drinking buddies, and motorcycle gangs have all formed at evo. We've drawn near when a close friend has been faced with a challenging time and have celebrated together when our once roommates-turned office mates-turned responsible parents have started cranking out little ones. When talking about a strained relationship that I was trying to navigate a couple years back, a wise friend once told me, ""Life is too short and it's also too long."" Life is too short but when you think about it, it can feel too long when you're not working with people that you love and respect and who love and respect you. This October we passed another major milestone in the company's history having opened our new flagship store, setting the stage for many to come. We must remember that working with friends is a key ingredient that got us here and will be as important if not more important as we look to the future with such big goals and aspirations.

Traxxas,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traxxas,https://traxxas.com,Racing,Sports,"TRAXXAS, The FASTEST Name In Radio Control.","Traxxas was started in 1986 with an idea for what was at that time an entirely new concept for a fully assembled, hobby-class R/C car. This new car would have all the same benefits of a hobby-class kit such as replaceable parts, hop-ups, and a high-quality component radio system, however it would be fully assembled with a colorful body, right out of the box.  Traxxas coined the term ""Ready-To-Run"" (RTR) to describe this new class. Since a fully assembled, ready-to-run car would appeal to the entry-level beginner, a toll-free customer support line was set up from day one to service an entirely new category of hobby consumer.  At first, acceptance of the RTR concept was slow because traditional R/C kits had always been unassembled. Once people realized that a Traxxas RTR had the same performance and quality as the traditional R/C kits, only that they didn't have to build it, the ready-to-run car was a runaway hit! A kit version would still be offered for those who still wanted to have the building experience. Over the next few years, Traxxas' electric RTR models continued to grow in features and performance. Models such as the Hawk and Radicator incorporated the handling, driveline and suspension geometry developed by a highly successful racing program.  Traxxas won many national and regional off-road championships and then offered kit versions of those winning cars as models such as the TRX-1 buggy, Blue Eagle racing truck, TCP buggy, and the SRT racing truck. TCPs and SRTs can still be found today racing competitively at local and regional levels. Traxxas' interest in R/C didn't just stop on land. In 1989 Traxxas applied the RTR concept to the world of R/C boating and developed the Villain IV deep-V offshore cruiser. There had never been anything like it with its scale appearance, twin motors, dual outdrives, and electronic speed control. Gone were the days of using messy, toxic glue to try and assemble your own boat hull. The Villain IV was ready-to-go, right out of the box. After a string of highly successful RTR electric models, Traxxas took the next step to develop the first RTR gas truck. When the legendary Nitro Hawk was released in 1992 it was an instant success and opened the door for a whole new wave of R/C nitro consumers.  Traxxas unraveled the complexities of nitro engines and made the awesome speed and power accessible to all hobby consumers, including a new breed of ""entry-level"" nitro consumers. In 1996, Traxxas made the first Ready-To-Run nitro boat, the Nitro Vee. It features water-cooling and the innovative Return-To-Shore feature which uses an auxiliary electric motor to drive the Nitro Vee back to the shore if the Nitro Engine runs out of fuel. It was also the first nitro boat to feature a clutch, which allows it to idle and drive at low speeds with the precision of an electric boat. And then, in 1999, T-Maxx arrived. With T-Maxx, Traxxas unleashed an all-out technological assault on the R/C world. It embodies the creative and energized spirit of a company that loves its craft and the products it creates.

As an industry leading manufacture for more than 20 years, Camp Chef produces high quality products offering efficient ways to cook for almost any outdoor gathering. From social functions to campouts or even dinner on the back patio, Camp Chef can do it all. In 1990, Camp Chef was established on the idea that there just had to be a better way to cook outdoors. We recognized many campers and sportsman had an interest in outdoor cooking but were struggling with what cooking equipment was available to them. That is when he designed a stove that would meet the needs of the avid outdoorsman. That simple stove design later became the Pro 60 and evolved to include the most versatile cooking system on the market by incorporating accessories to simplify and diversify any outdoor menu. BBQ boxes, flattop griddles, and pizza ovens now give users the ability to grill, griddle, bake, boil, brew fry, stream, and even cook Dutch oven - all on a single Camp Chef stove. After being in the campsite for nearly 10 years, Camp Chef began producing quality cast iron cookware with its signature True-Seasoned Finish. Another 10 years later Camp Chef addressed the demand for a versatile outdoor cooking system at home. Today there are several stoves, smokers, fire pits and more, designed specifically with the home and patio in mind. However, the roots of the company are in the great outdoors, continuing to give people the opportunity to experience nature without sacrificing a hearty meal. Camp Chef is located in the heart of Cache Valley, Utah, surrounded by the beautiful Bear River Mountain Range, a perfect site for product testing. Each product is a result of Camp Chef's dedication to outdoor cooking and its pledge to improve and create new products that fulfill the needs of its highly valued customers.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/camp-chef,,https://twitter.com/camp_chef,https://www.facebook.com/campchef/,"166,593"

Grip Boost,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grip-boost,http://www.gripboost.com/,"Sporting Goods, Sports","Commerce and Shopping, Sports",GB is a University of Maryland spin-out company that makes polymer-gel coatings to extend the life and performance of football gloves.,"Grip Boost Inc. has developed a quick-drying polymer-based gel technology that extends the life and performance of football gloves. Football players at all levels of competition, from the NFL down to youth leagues, wear tacky gloves to enhance their ability to grip the football during the game. These gloves offer football players the extra tackified grip they need to make game-changing plays. Unfortunately, these gloves lose their tackiness/grip quickly due to intense frictional contact (e.g. glove-jerseys, glove-ground) experienced throughout practices and games during the football season; usually the grip on a pair of brand-new gloves wears down after just a few days of practice.  In response to this market need, the Grip Boost Football Gel was invented by a professional football player and team of chemical engineers at the University of Maryland. This new product is a quick-drying polymer-based gel. To use the product, a player simply applies a small amount of the gel onto his gloves, rubs his hands together, and a thin polymer film forms on the gloves in less than 15 seconds—rapid enough to apply between plays during a game or practice. The Grip Boost polymer-gel solution is completely non-toxic, employs green chemistry, and is produced from natural polymers that are found in crab shell waste. Additionally, the Grip Boost polymer film adheres to the gloves and leaves no residue on the football, which is crucial for legal usage.  The original inventors formed Grip Boost in Spring 2014 to propel commercialization of the gel technology; in Fall 2014, pilot scale batches of the product were sold online through GripBoost.com and the Amazon Marketplace. After strong reviews and positive feedback in football market, Grip Boost Inc. launched grip products in baseball and golf in Fall 2015 and Summer 2016. The company currently operates out of the UMBC Research and Technology Park as part of the bwtech@UMBC incubator program where it produces and sells the Grip Boost products on www.GripBoost.com, local retail stores and the Amazon Marketplace.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/grip-boost-llc,,https://twitter.com/GripBoost,https://www.facebook.com/gripboost,"177,674"

The action of the Zig Jig is unequaled in its ability to attract and catch fish. The offset shape of the Zig Jig head creates a zig zag, back and forth action as it falls. This unique action keeps the Zig Jig in the strike zone longer and gives the illusion of wounded prey, which drives fish crazy. We offer the Best Marabou jigs in the market.

Once the brand started to gain momentum, Kemper moved its board production to a snowboard factory in Montreal, Canada for the 1988/89 snowboarding season. In 1989/90 the snowboard production moved to Austria.  Kemper Snowboards quickly became one of the biggest snowboarding brands in snowboard history and competed directly against Burton Snowboards, Sims Snowboards, and Barfoot Snowboards. The Kemper snowboarding brand was best remembered for fully embracing snowboarding’s neon period in both their snowboard graphics and their incredible range of funky outerwear. In 1989 business was booming and Kemper had one of the best professional snowboard teams of the era. David Kemper eventually partnered with a windsurfing distribution company in Glendale, California called the Romney Group who added Kemper Snowboards to their portfolio of snowboarding brands. During that time, David relocated to California to help oversee the business, team management, and the growing product line. In 1992, David sold his remaining shares of the company to focus on his college education.  By 1994 the company was sold to an in-line skate company on the east coast. A couple of years shortly after, Kemper Snowboards officially went out of business. In the winter of 2018, Jib Hunt, a former professional snowboarder, relaunched the Kemper Snowboards brand. In the summer of 2019, Hunt moved Kemper’s headquarters from the east coast to Park City, Utah to better position the snowboarding brand for growth and exposure within the Utah snowboarding scene. Kemper Snowboards produces freestyle snowboards, park snowboards, powder snowboards, splitboards, and snowboards packages. The original Kemper professional snowboard team consisted of Mike Basich, Tina Basich, Dave Dowd, Martin Gallant, Kurt Heine, Andy Hetzel, Brett Johnson, Adam Merriman, George Pappas, Nick Perata, J.D.

Prior to creating River Studios, in 2012 Mike founded Rothenberg Ventures, a seed-stage venture capital firm based in San Francisco and the leading VC for Frontier Technology startups.  In January 2015, identifying the huge potential in VR, Rothenberg decided to build the world's first startup accelerator program focused on VR companies, and named it The River Accelerator Program, run by Rothenberg Ventures at the time.  After the River Accelerator 2015 Spring program, Mike founded River Studios to create, build and promote frontier technology including VR, AR, and AI and to advise and partner with clients like Rothenberg Ventures.   River Studios' team of experienced cinematographers helped the River Accelerator identify and cultivate startups to produce better technology and VR content, which started to draw the attention of artists and brands, that in turn asked to work with River Studios to help them understand, build, and create VR & AR content.  In 2015, a client project that combined production with development work inspired the studio to partner closely with Twisted Oak Studios, one of the most talented Unity 3D development studios in the world, which unofficially became known as ""River Studios Canada"".

When Lynx Professional Grills was started in 1996, the company was committed to elevating outdoor cooking to new levels. At that time, outdoor cooking meant barbecue grills. But within a few years, the trend for outdoor living took off with Lynx perfectly positioned to capitalize on the demand for luxury outdoor kitchens. The creation of Lynx Professional Grills was the vision of a group of people who, for more than 30 years, had been manufacturing stainless steel products for the commercial restaurant industry under the brand BECA. These products were engineered to stand up to heavy use and the test of time, the same ""design elements"" needed for outdoor kitchen products, which must endure extreme weather conditions. The founders of Lynx Professional Grills were committed to incorporating the same high standards used for commercial restaurant kitchen products — quality materials, fine craftsmanship and innovation — into the company's collection of luxury outdoor kitchen products and accessories for the consumer. When Lynx products were introduced, the company sold the Lynx Professional Grill (free standing and built-in models), access door, side burners and a cocktail station, which were built exclusively for outdoor use. Made of stainless steel, the eye-catching grill set the standard for form and function, delivering such a great cooking experience that it soon became known as the ""world's greatest grill."" Consumers loved that it was easy to clean, too. Because it's manufactured using a special welding technique, the grill has no gaps or seams where moisture and grease can collect. The Lynx family of products soon expanded when the outdoor living trend emerged. To help consumers create the luxurious outdoor kitchen of their dreams, Lynx introduced a line of additional products built for durability and performance — and all with the company's trademark sleek stainless steel look.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/lynx-professional-grills,,https://twitter.com/LynxGrills,https://www.facebook.com/LynxProfessionalGrills,"227,118"

Wheel Shields are a longboard skateboarding accessory with three powerful features: Splash Protection - Typically when skating over a puddle or wet environment, your wheels will fling dirty water all over your clothes. Instead, Wheel Shields act similar to a mud flap and keep rain and sludge on the ground. Your longboard is now a versatile all-weather transportation vehicle.   ""Wheel bite"" elimination - ""Wheel bite"" is a dangerous safety problem that injured Chase and inspired him to invent Wheel Shields. “Wheel bite” occurs during a hard turn when the bottom of the board comes in contact with the top of the wheel. This stops the wheel suddenly and throws the rider to the ground. By creating a physical barrier around each wheel, Wheel Shields effectively eliminate “wheel bite”. Instead of the board coming in contact with the wheel, it is stopped by the Wheel Shield, allowing the wheel to rotate freely.  New tricks - Wheel Shields also allow riders to stand directly on top of their wheels, opening up all sorts of new trick possibilities. You can invent brand new manuals, colemans, slides and dances with Wheel Shields!  Wheel Shields work universally with almost any longboard and attach to the end of each truck axle. We originally designed Wheel Shields to work with the nuts that come standard on longboards, but found that Wheel Shields would rotate off if you hit a curb or pushed them sideways. Wheel Shields mount using our custom nut setup to ensure they stay firmly in place. Almost all trucks are compatible with the custom nuts except Churchill RKPs, which have a non-standard thread count on the axle.  Wheel Shields work with almost all wheels 75mm and under. Certain wheels with massive contact patches or extreme shapes won’t work, but almost all of your favorites will.

Skyhawks,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skyhawks,http://www.skyhawks.com/,"Children, Soccer, Sports","Community and Lifestyle, Sports",Skyhawks is a skill-focused sports camp offering safe and fun programs for kids of all ages.,"Skyhawks is a skill-focused sports camp offering safe and fun programs for kids of all ages. In 1979, Jeff Heimbigner recognized that children of varying athletic levels did not have the same opportunity to learn sport-specific skills as serious players or elite young athletes. Many of these children aspired to be better players, but unfortunately did not have the best setting in which to learn sport-specific skills, have fun, be safe, and take those lessons home and apply them to their everyday lives. Jeff had a vision that every child should experience the joy and benefits of sports. Jeff created a purpose for the company: “Teaching life skills through sports.” With his vision and purpose stated, Skyhawks Sports was born. Skyhawks Sports started as a regional soccer program focused in the Pacific Northwest. The popularity of the camps grew as the years went by, and some amazing athletes and wonderful individuals emerged. The Skyhawks Sports soccer-focused camps emphasized critical lessons in life, such as sportsmanship, teamwork, and winning and losing with grace. Remaining true to its purpose and vision, Skyhawks added more sports to the offering and safe, fun, and skill-focused sports camps were realized. Over the last 30 years, vibrant memories have been created in the lives of students, coaches, and long-term associates of Skyhawks. Hundreds of excited children arrive when Skyhawks Sports comes to town to hold a sports camp. Full of interaction and excitement, the camps provide great fun for everyone, and our best camps are known to have a festival-like atmosphere. The most incredible part of a Skyhawks Sports camp is that the children forget that they are learning very valuable sport and life skills, because those lessons are so well integrated with friendly and fascinating play. Most important to us, and the purpose of Skyhawks Sports, is to teach life skills through sports. The development of Skyhawks Sports has been a wonderful ride for everyone involved, and we expect to continue to make a difference--one child at a time. Today we offer 15 different sports (Soccer, Basketball, Flag Football, Baseball, Multi-Sport, Tennis, Mini-Hawk, Lacrosse, Golf, Volleyball, Cheerleading, and Track & Field) camps and programs, providing countless ways for your child to grow. The formats of our 11 different sports camps and programs include traditional weeklong summer day camps and year-round after-school programs that range from 45 minutes to 6 hours in duration, per day. Our progression of camps and programs, led by our expert staff, are geared toward youth looking for a sport introduction or those who want to refine and master their sport-specific skills. Skyhawks Sports has proven to be the leader in youth sports since 1979. One of the things that makes Skyhawks trustworthy is that we go the extra mile to focus on safety, and we have a long-standing proven safety track record and processes to prove it. Safety highlights include: Pioneering industry standards since 1979 for safety and curriculum Holding the health and safety of our campers in the highest regard Generating glowing consumer testimonials This was the best camp! My child was totally entertained and engaged at all times!! The coaches were prepared and had endless energy! Loved it!!! - Sarah (Granite Bay, CA) All of our fond memories have been possible because of parents like you with your wonderful children.

The Company intends to acquire 4-6 horses in its claiming division before acquiring horses for its allowance/stakes division.

The purse money is significantly higher in allowance and stakes level races.  Claiming refers to the process by which a licensed person may purchase a horse entered in a race designated as a “claiming race” for a predetermined price. When a horse has been claimed, its new owner assumes title after the starting gate opens although the former owner is entitled to all purse money earned in that race.
