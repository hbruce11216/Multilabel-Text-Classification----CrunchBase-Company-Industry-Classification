Our focus was to deliver one platform for spas to manage their business, and SpaBooker was an instant success. We quickly expanded the team, feature set, and customer base.

We realized this vision stretched beyond the name SpaBooker, leading us to spin out as GramercyOne, with SpaBooker as its product. Shortly thereafter, we brought on new investors in our Series A financing of $14.5M, enabling us to build out our executive team, enter several new verticals, and sign new partnerships with major publishers. Over the following year, as we continued our breakout growth, we recognized that our name was creating an unneeded divide between our company and our products.

Children are guided through visual puzzles and games designed to help them see the big ideas behind math, rather than memorize facts. Virtual toy building bricks take the place of traditional manipulatives, with studs on the surface representing numeric value. The platform adjusts to each child's level and comes with a suite of analytics that track learning outcomes. Off computer hands-on projects further extend learning.  The MathBRIX mission is to create new learning technologies that will make a significant social and economic impact over time. For the US to remain a world economic leader, all children must be able to think mathematically and problem-solve. Children behind in kindergarten, often stay behind through the remaining school years. Only 40% of U.S. fourth grade students are deemed proficient on national math assessments. Early intervention is key. The visual strategies are derived from the federally-funded Comprehensive School Mathematics Program. Twenty years of research found CSMP students had greater ability to solve novel math problems. CSMP was effective with the gifted as well as the learning challenged. MathBRIX testing with over 500 students confirms high student engagement, feasibility, promise of learning. A larger test is underway in 34 districts nation-wide.

However, cloud services and technologies can be significantly more powerful than they are now.

With funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Chameleon project will provide such a large-scale platform to the open research community allowing them explore transformative concepts in deeply programmable cloud services, design, and core technologies. Chameleon will allow users to explore problems ranging from the creation of Software as a Service to kernel support for virtualization. This broad range of supported research includes many other areas such as developing Platforms as a Service, creating new and optimizing existing Infrastructure as a Service components, investigating software-defined networking, and optimizing virtualization technologies. The Chameleon testbed, will be deployed at the University of Chicago and the Texas Advanced Computing Center and will consist of 650 multi-core cloud nodes, 5PB of total disk space, and leverage 100 Gbps connection between the sites. While a large part of the testbed will consist of homogenous hardware to support large-scale experiments, a portion of it will support heterogeneous units allowing experimentation with high-memory, large-disk, low-power, GPU, and co-processor units. The project will also leverage existing FutureGrid hardware at the University of Chicago and the Texas Advanced Computing Center in its first year to provide a transition period for the existing FutureGrid community of experimental users. To support the broad range of experiments experiments described above, the project will support a graduated configuration system allowing full user configurability of the software stack, from provisioning of bare metal and network interconnects to delivery of fully functioning cloud environments. A special feature of Chameleon is that it provides for an exceptionally close integration of clouds and networks, which substantially enhances the capabilities of both. In addition, to facilitate experiments, Chameleon will support a set of services designed to meet researchers needs, including support for experimental management, reproducibility, and repositories of trace and workload data of production cloud workloads. The project is led by the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago and partners from the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin, the International Center for Advanced Internet Research at Northwestern University, the Ohio State University, and University of Texas at San Antonio, comprising a highly qualified and experienced team.

Connect,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/connect-org,http://www.connect.org,"Association, Communities, Life Science, Non Profit","Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Other, Science and Engineering","Connect helps entrepreneurs with expert guidance, access to capital, and the business tools they need.","CONNECT is a regional program  that catalyzes the creation of innovative technology and life sciences products in San Diego County by linking inventors and entrepreneurs with the resources they need for success.  Since 1985, CONNECT has assisted in the formation and development of more than 3,000 companies. The leadership of CONNECT attributes its success to the unique culture of collaboration between industry, capital sources, professional service providers and research organizations that CONNECT has sought to foster in the region. CONNECT was originally founded as a part of the University of California (UC) San Diego in the mid-80s.  At that time traditional industries in the region were on the decline, the attraction of companies to the San Diego region was very difficult and region leaders were searching for a path to economic renewal and sustained growth. Meanwhile, innovative high tech and life sciences companies such as IMED, IVAC, Linkabit, SAIC, Qualcomm and Hybritech were quietly developing in the San Diego region, fueled in part by technology and scientists at research institutions on the Torrey Pines Mesa.  UC San Diego, the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation and private sector business leaders recognized in this an opportunity for CONNECT to transform San Diego’s growing research capabilities into commercially viable products and businesses that would ultimately increase the prosperity of the region. By leveraging the various assets within the region, CONNECT focuses its efforts on accelerating the commercialization of new technology and life sciences products. While that mission has stayed relatively true since its initial creation, the organization and its program offerings have continued to evolve in response to the changes in the region’s economic climate. At the time that CONNECT was being founded, UC San Diego was just beginning to mature as a research institution, and there were a small number of other research institutions in the region. Over the years as San Diego’s technology and life sciences clusters have matured, UC San Diego has continued to grow, and in tandem, so has the entire research base of the region.  Today, San Diego has more than 80 research institutions; about two thirds are part of the UC San Diego system, and the rest include private research organizations and a number of other academic-based research institutions. In 2005, to better serve the entire research community, CONNECT spun-out of UC San Diego and formed the CONNECT Association, a 501c6 trade organization and CONNECT Foundation, a 501c3 charitable foundation.  As a result of spinning-out from UC San Diego, CONNECT has been able to broaden its mandate to include public advocacy work on behalf of its members through the trade organization. Today, CONNECT is focused on delivering the fundamental programs that the innovation community depends upon.  At the same time the organization is creating new services to meet the needs of the evolving economic and policy landscape and the new clusters that are developing within the region.  Challenges include attracting investment capital and engineering and experienced management talent. The organization views its “sweet-spot” as the “beginning of the food chain” – the point when the market potential of an innovation is being assessed and then commercialized.  Toward this end, CONNECT works with innovators in research institutions, early stage and growth companies and major corporations.  Whether a company is looking to spin out or license an innovation, launch a second or third product into a new market or evaluate the commercial potential of a discovery CONNECT has experienced entrepreneurs-in-residence who can assess the innovation and coach the innovators through the process. Throughout the last quarter of a century CONNECT has assisted clusters in developing their own trade organizations as they become large enough and deep enough to sustain a stand-alone organization focused on the cluster’s specific technical needs.  Organizations that CONNECT has assisted in fostering over the years include BIOCOM, CommNexus San Diego, CleanTECH San Diego and Wireless Life Sciences Alliance.  CONNECT either creates or participates in the creation of a cluster trade organization as the cluster evolves and grows within the region.  It is currently partnering in the creation of a biomimicry proof of concept center that will lead to the development of biomimicry clusters across the US.  In addition it is incubating an action and sports organization led by NBA legend Bill Walton called SD Sport Innovators to focus on the advanced technologies found within the sporting industry such as high performance materials and designs, clean technology and wireless and remote monitoring. Continual development of new strategies by the board of directors and staff leadership team to meet the evolving needs of the innovation economy keeps CONNECT relevant to its members.  It has enabled the organization to deliver measurable results to the companies served, even in the midst of the recent recession.  In addition, the organization recognizes that each member company or organization is unique.  Therefore, the staff works to tailor its programming and individual assistance in order to ensure these specific needs are being met.   This approach has led to a stable base of membership that grows consistently each year. CONNECT’s annual budget is approximately $3 million.  About half of the organization’s revenue is primarily generated from membership dues paid by industry, professional service providers, research institutions and venture capital firms.  Members provide additional sponsorship revenue for individual programs.  This base of revenue enables CONNECT to provide mentoring and educational programming either free or at a very low cost for researchers and early and growth stage companies.  The revenue from ticket and table sales, along with a small number of grants mainly from private foundations makes up the balance of CONNECT’s budget. As a result of its efforts, CONNECT has assisted more than 3,000 companies in attracting more than $2 billion in investment capital.  CONNECT is widely regarded as one of the world’s most successful organizations linking inventors and entrepreneurs with the resources they need for commercialization of innovative products.The program has been modeled in more than 50 regions around the world – most recently in New York City, Bogotá, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. CONNECT has recently been recognized by Inc., Time and Entrepreneur magazines and received the 2010 Innovation in Economic Development Award from the U.S. Department of Commerce for creation of Regional Innovation Clusters.  CONNECT also manages the San Diego Innovation Hub (iHub) designated by the state of California Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2010.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/1137636,,http://twitter.com/CONNECTinSD,http://www.facebook.com/CONNECTinSD,"91,952"

It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Washington, D.C. and was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born and-trained architect who won a competition organized by President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1792. President John Adams, elected in 1796 as the second President, was the first resident of the White House. Abigail Adams, President Adams' wife, was known to have complained about the largely unfinished new residence. President Thomas Jefferson, upon moving to the house in 1801, was also not impressed, and dismissed the house as being too big. Jefferson made several structural changes under architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe such as the addition of terrace-pavilions on either side of the main building and single-story wings for storage. In addition to replacing the slate roof with one of sheet iron, Jefferson further improved the grounds by landscaping them in a picturesque manner. While James Madison was President from 1809 to 1817, the White House was torched by the British in the War of 1812. Although the fire was put out by a summer thunderstorm, all that remained were the outside, charred walls and the interior brick walls. Madison brought Hoban back to restore the mansion, which took three years. It was during this construction that the house was painted white. Hoban later added the South and North Porticos, using a slightly altered design by Latrobe. Thereafter, further more alterations were made. Today, the White House Complex includes the executive residence, west wing, east wing, the Eisenhower executive office building—the former state department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president—and Blair House, a guest residence. The executive residence is made up of six stories—the ground floor, state floor, second floor, and third floor, as well as a two-story basement. The term White House is often used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/22507/,,http://twitter.com/whitehouse,http://www.facebook.com/whitehouse,"95,340"

Since inception GP has deployed $356.5 million in impact investments to 135 partners, bringing meaningful impact to over 14.7 million lives in 21 countries. What is Impact-First Investing? Impact-first investing means investing in a way that seeks the highest possible social impact, while seeking to preserve capital with a modest financial return for investors. Impact-first investing is distinctly different from return-first investing, which seeks the highest possible financial return (often without consideration of social or environmental consequences), and from philanthropy, which seeks the highest social impact without any preservation of capital. We believe that impact-first investing has an essential role to play in advancing sustainable solutions to poverty for millions of people worldwide. What Does Impact Mean to Global Partnerships? All of our impact-first investing is aimed at empowering poor and marginalized people to earn a living, provide the basic necessities of life for their families, and improve their lives. We seek social impact on four dimensions: Broadening Opportunity – We have a holistic understanding of poverty, so we invest across all facets of poverty: livelihoods, education, energy, health, housing, sanitation, and water. Deepening Inclusion – We invest at the edge of the market, emphasizing approaches that include people marginalized by depth of poverty, gender, and/or geography, including women and the rural poor. Serving Millions – We believe that every person matters, and want to expand opportunity for as many people as possible. We therefore focus on sustainable approaches that can, over time, scale to serve millions of people living in poverty. Improving Lives – We only invest where evidence convinces us that people living in poverty value the opportunity being delivered and are empowered by it – economically or otherwise – to improve their lives.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/globalpartnerships,Crunchbase Venture Program,https://www.twitter.com/gpsocialimpact,https://www.facebook.com/globalpartnerships,"164,180"

Their online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions are coordinated by a global network active in over 188 countries. The number 350 means climate safety: to preserve a livable planet, scientists tell us they must reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from its current level of 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm. They believe that a global grassroots movement can hold their leaders accountable to the realities of science and the principles of justice. That movement is rising from the bottom up all over the world, and is uniting to create the solutions that will ensure a better future for all. 350.org was founded by a group of university friends in the U.S. along with author Bill McKibben, who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public. When they started organizing in 2008, they saw climate change as the most important issue facing humanity — but climate action was mired in politics and all but stalled. They didn’t know how to fix things, but they knew that one missing ingredient was a climate movement that reflected the scale of the crisis. So they started organizing coordinated days of action that linked activists and organizations around the world, including the International Day of Climate Action in 2009, the Global Work Party in 2010, Moving Planet in 2011, and Climate Impacts Day in 2012. They held the “world’s biggest art installation” and “the most widespread day of political action in the planet’s history.” They figured that if they were going to be a movement, then they had to start acting like one. Click here to watch videos of these global mobilisations.  Today, 350.org works in almost every country in the world on campaigns like fighting coal power plants in India, stopping the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S, and divesting public institutions everywhere from fossil fuels. All of their work leverages people power to dismantle the influence and infrastructure of the fossil fuel industry, and to develop people-centric solutions to the climate crisis.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/350-org/,,https://twitter.com/350,https://www.facebook.com/350.org,"171,368"

In 1903, the Teamsters started as a merger of the two leading team driver associations. These drivers were the backbone of America’s robust economic growth, but they needed to organize to wrest their fair share from greedy corporations. Today, the Union’s task is exactly the same.  The Teamsters are known as the champion of freight drivers and warehouse workers, but have organized workers in virtually every occupation imaginable, both professional and non-professional, private sector and public sector.  Our 1.4 million members are public defenders in Minnesota; vegetable workers in California; sanitation workers in New York; brewers in St. Louis; newspaper workers in Seattle; construction workers in Las Vegas; zoo keepers in Pennsylvania; healthcare workers in Rhode Island; bakery workers in Maine; airline pilots, secretaries and police officers. Name the occupation and chances are we represent those workers somewhere.  Teamsters stand ready to organize workers who want to bargain collectively. Once a contract is negotiated and signed, the Union works to enforce it—holding management’s feet to the fire and invoking contract grievance procedures if management chooses not to. Wages and benefits under Teamster contracts are markedly better than those of non-union employees in similar jobs. Teamster contracts are the guarantors of decent wages, fair promotion, health coverage, job security, paid time-off and retirement income. The Teamsters Union also performs vital tasks in such areas as pension management, safety & health, community outreach, governmental affairs and communications. For more than a century, the Teamsters have been a public voice for the rights and aspirations of working men and women and a key player in securing them.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-brotherhood-of-teamsters,,https://twitter.com/teamsters,https://www.facebook.com/teamsters,"173,672"

UNICEF has the global authority to influence decision-makers, and the variety of partners at grassroots level to turn the most innovative ideas into reality. That makes UNICEF unique among world organizations, and unique among those working with the young.  UNICEF believes that nurturing and caring for children are the cornerstones of human progress. UNICEF was created with this purpose in mind – to work with others to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child’s path.  UNICEF believes that they can, together, advance the cause of humanity.  UNICEF advocates for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person’s future. UNICEF promotes girls’ education – ensuring that they complete primary education as a minimum – because it benefits all children, both girls and boys. Girls who are educated grow up to become better thinkers, better citizens, and better parents to their own children.  UNICEF acts so that all children are immunized against common childhood diseases, and are well nourished, because it is wrong for a child to suffer or die from a preventable illness.  UNICEF works to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among young people because it is right to keep them from harm and enable them to protect others. UNICEF helps children and families affected by HIV/AIDS to live their lives with dignity.  UNICEF involves everyone in creating protective environments for children. UNICEF is present to relieve suffering during emergencies, and wherever children are threatened, because no child should be exposed to violence, abuse or exploitation.  UNICEF upholds the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  We work to assure equality for those who are discriminated against, girls and women in particular. UNICEF works for the Millennium Development Goals and for the progress promised in the United Nations Charter. UNICEF strives for peace and security. We work to hold everyone accountable to the promises made for children.  UNICEF is part of the Global Movement for Children – a broad coalition dedicated to improving the life of every child.

Fred B. Anschutz's (1909-1993) career was characterized by uncanny and intuitive foresight and by a willingness to enter into ventures others considered too risky. His first business success came through striking a rich oil field in his home state of Kansas. Earnings from an oil exploration business that eventually spanned Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming were parlayed into ranches and livestock operations across the West. The family and their business headquarters moved from Wichita to Denver in the 1960's. Marian P. Anschutz (1910-1986) with husband, Fred, ingrained traditional American values of hard work, community involvement and love of the land in their children and grandchildren.  Sue Anschutz-Rodgers has continued her parents' legacy through her own business and ranching ventures and commitment to philanthropy. The Foundation's assets have grown over its 34 year history from the original $4.5 million endowment to $56.4 million through investments and additional family contributions. Sue served as the Foundation's first President and Executive Director and currently serves as its Chair and President. Four of the founders' six grandchildren and two great grandchildren serve as trustees of the Foundation, while granddaughter Susan Rodgers Drumm served as program officer from 1994-2001.  Since its inception, the Foundation has distributed 8,671 grants to nonprofit organizations for a total of $50,183,941. The Foundation's focus on supporting organizations that meet human and community needs in Colorado has remained steady throughout its existence. In the early years, the Foundation funded fewer organizations with larger grants. Gradually, the philosophy shifted to providing smaller grants ($2,500-$10,000) to many organizations. The intent was to spread the Foundation's resources into more areas and to encourage nonprofits to develop diversified funding streams. Although the primary activity of the Foundation is grant making, considerable energy has and will be directed to efforts to build the capacity of Colorado's nonprofit sector, to enhance grant making, and to work collaboratively with other funders.  In the early 1990's, the Foundation partnered with the Community Resource Center to orchestrate Colorado Rural Philanthropy Days, a twice-yearly event that built on an initiative of the nonprofit community in Mesa County. Sue's vision in launching this event, which is still going strong today, was to increase foundation support to rural areas of the state. The intent is for private and public funders, who are concentrated in the Front Range, to visit Colorado's rural communities to gain a greater understanding of the issues and challenges faced in those communities and to facilitate introductions between metro-based funders and Colorado's rural nonprofit leaders and local elected officials. Colorado Rural Philanthropy Days address two of the Foundation's goals: to increase funding to nonprofit organizations in rural Colorado and to demystify the grant-making process.  The Foundation plans to continue on its current path of embracing opportunities that enhance the nonprofit sector and focusing on organizations that strengthen families and communities and assist people to help themselves.",,,,,"228,128"

We focus particularly on providing answers to questions surrounding the book of Genesis, as it is the most-attacked book of the Bible. We also desire to train others to develop a biblical worldview, and seek to expose the bankruptcy of evolutionary ideas, and its bedfellow, a “millions of years old” earth (and even older universe). AiG teaches that “facts” don’t speak for themselves, but must be interpreted. That is, there aren’t separate sets of “evidences” for evolution and creation—we all deal with the same evidence (we all live on the same earth, have the same fossils, observe the same animals, etc.). The difference lies in how we interpret what we study. The Bible—the “history book of the universe”—provides a reliable, eye-witness account of the beginning of all things, and can be trusted to tell the truth in all areas it touches on. Therefore, we are able to use it to help us make sense of this present world. When properly understood, the “evidence” confirms the biblical account. For an elaboration of AiG’s presuppositional thrust check out our Answers section—for example, learn how the Bible offers the best explanation of the world’s geology, astronomy, and genetics.

Former Indianapolis Sentinel reporter John Holliday founded The News. It published Monday through Saturday. Under Holliday, The News was politically neutral and committed to the community. It exposed graft by Indiana Supreme Court judges in 1876. It pushed for the creation of the first city charter and a Chamber of Commerce. The News fought an attempt by Standard Oil Co. to distribute natural gas in Indianapolis. In 1909, a libel suit was filed against The News by the federal government when the newspaper questioned Theodore Roosevelt’s work on the Panama Canal deal. Editors of The News were indicted but refused to be tried in Washington, saying the trial should be held in Indianapolis where the alleged libel took place. The judge ruled in favor of The News, and the ruling still stands as a landmark victory for the freedom of the press. Holliday ran the paper until ill health forced him to sell to a group of investors led by William H. Smith of Chicago and Charles Warren Fairbanks. Fairbanks was a former secretary of state and served as vice president during Theodore Roosevelt’s second term. Smith served as publisher until his death in 1896. His son Delavan Smith was publisher from 1896 until 1921. Fairbanks' sons Warren, Frederick and Richard would serve as publishers successively from 1921-44. Under Warren Fairbanks, The News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for an 18-month campaign to cut waste in city and county government. The News would become Indiana’s largest newspaper and would be known as ""The Great Hoosier Daily."" In 1948, Eugene C. Pulliam purchased The News from the Fairbanks family and remained its publisher until his death in 1975. When The Indianapolis Times folded in 1965, The News became the city’s only evening newspaper. Eugene S. Pulliam became publisher in 1975 after his father died and served until his own death in 1999. Dale Duncan was named his successor. The trend of declining circulation and the demise of afternoon newspapers across the country had finally hit The News. In 1995, the newsroom staffs of The Star and The News merged, but the editorial staffs and pages remained separate. On Oct. 1, 1999, The Indianapolis News published its last newspaper. The Indianapolis Star celebrated its 100th anniversary on June 6, 2003. The brainchild of Muncie industrialist George F. McCulloch, The Star challenged the two existing morning newspapers in the city, the Journal and the Sentinel. McCulloch paid a balloonist $650 to drop red stars on the city in the days leading up to the launch on June 6, 1903. Others were dropped from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which had been dedicated the previous May. A year and two days after The Star began, it absorbed the Journal, and in 1906 it purchased the Indianapolis Sunday Sentinel.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-indianapolis-star,,http://twitter.com/indystar,http://www.facebook.com/indianapolis.star,"238,916"

Alan readily admits that their original paradigm of serving the homeless had some flaws, but with the help of a formerly homeless man, they perfected the model that they successfully use today. That first trip was in September of 1998; by December of that year there was enough money to purchase a 1997 Ford F-250 pick-up truck with a catering bed. Since that first truck run, teams of volunteers have served meals with a side of hope to the homeless and working poor on the streets of Austin and San Antonio, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. To date, Mobile Loaves & Fishes has served over 4 million meals, and with the support of more than 18,000 volunteers, they are the largest prepared feeding program to the homeless and working poor in Austin. Today, in addition to continuing their truck ministry, they have expanded to include their Community First! Housing Program and the ROADS Micro-Enterprise Program.

Renewable forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, rely on manufactured components more so than extractable energy such as oil. A vibrant manufacturing sector will be needed to supply the new materials needed to rebuild America’s decaying infrastructure and to create a low-carbon economy. The manufacturing sector employs workers at all skill and education levels, and is a particularly important provider of jobs with good wages for workers without a college degree. It employs a higher share of workers without a college degree than does the economy overall. Manufacturing is one of the most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy. It is responsible for roughly two-thirds, or roughly $208 billion, of all U.S. business research and development spending. U.S. manufacturing employment was relatively stable between 1970 and 1998, and never fell below 16.5 million workers. The United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs between March 1998 and 2013. So what can you do? Imagine creating jobs with the swipe of your credit card or helping thousands of unemployed punch a time clock – all because you simply paid closer attention to your shopping decisions. Buying American-made is the most direct way anyone can support American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs. We, as Americans, have the ability to change our own course, expand our middle class, re-ignite our manufacturing base, and provide the opportunity for those less fortunate to join an expanding middle class.",,,,,"301,531"

Canines for Disabled Kids works to support the creation of child-canine service dog teams to promote independence and social awareness. Offering free services to families and communities across the United States, Canines for Disabled Kids helps connect children with the service dog that can best help them overcome limitations caused by a variety of disabilities while helping communities to be welcoming and supportive of the special canine tools being used. Scholarships to help cover the training costs are offered, another way Canines for Disabled Kids helps to bring these teams together.  A 501C3 non-profit organization, Canines for Disabled Kids work to support children and service dogs on their road to being as independent as possible. Your support is critical in helping us to help them.  Canines for Disabled Kids (CDK) began in 1998 as an offshoot of the NEADS, Dog for Deaf and Disabled Americans training program. Very few service dog programs were willing to provide trained service dogs for children. CDK believed it was possible to train dogs to help autistic children, children with hearing impairments, other physical disabilities and set out to help families find the best training programs for their children.  In an effort to enhance the education and independence of children with disabilities across the USA, we started to provide scholarship help cover some of the training cost. Soon, many families were coming to the program. Since 1998; CDK has sponsored over 130 service dogs, dogs that can help children with different disabilities; some with their parents as facilitators, or supervisors, and others independently.  CDK used scholarships to encourage the placement of service dogs with children. By providing needed funding to the training organization, CDK was able to increase the number of children being accepted for service dogs and has been able to reduce the wait time for many of these children to between 3 months and 1 year, rather than 2 years or more. Over 200 training programs are eligible for the scholarships offered.  CDK also developed a strong educational presentation program to provide information to the public about service dogs, public access and their role with individuals overcoming limitations of a variety of disabilities. These programs are offered all over the country to schools, civic groups and businesses.  Advocating for individuals with service animals became a natural extension of these education programs. CDK staff now works with families across the country helping to determine if a service dog is the right tool and which training organization is the best match for the needs of the individual.  Educational presentations, advocacy, and consulting are offered to all nationwide at no cost.

This critical phase of your life challenges you to seek out contrasting views, expand your knowledge and interests, and form your own, distinct identity. As you discover your purpose and find your voice, forging a path forward in today’s world, The National Society of Leadership and Success is here to help. After all, we believe that no one succeeds solely on their own, as dreams are realized through perseverance and support; however ambitious your aspirations may be, however daunting the obstacles may seem--know that you are not alone. Towards that end, a key part of our offerings are thought pieces and inspirational video content from leaders in areas as diverse as media and defense. In addition, we provide training sessions on topics from goal-setting to personal and professional accountability, and curate a series of compelling, interactive national lectures that challenges viewers to transform their lives and future careers. In the past, we’ve featured leaders such as Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, The Today Show host Al Roker, and Inc. Magazine’s #1 Leadership Expert John C. Maxwell. Though success comes in many fields and in many forms, our speakers share three key traits: a hunger to succeed in all they do, the willingness to push their boundaries, and most importantly, confidence in uncomfortable and challenging situations. These world-class leaders are driven, capable, and incredibly successful, but they all understand this: an individual’s success stems from a group effort built around inspirational mentors, friends, and loved ones. That’s why they’re paying it forward, sharing their hard-won experience and valuable knowledge, and arming you with vital insights for the road ahead.  In our view, learning and personal progress are lifelong endeavors, and in order to prepare our members to create positive, lasting change, we strive to build an inclusive, supportive community.

Hydrocephalus Association,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hydrocephalus-association,http://www.hydroassoc.org,"Association, Communities, Health Care, Non Profit","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other",Hydrocephalus Association is to promote a cure for hydrocephalus and improve the lives of those affected by the condition.,"The Hydrocephalus Association serves as the primary nexus for research on hydrocephalus, a condition defined by an abnormal, excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cavities of the brain. Hydrocephalus affects over 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Approximately 1-2 babies for every 1000 births are born with hydrocephalus, but anyone can get hydrocephalus at any time through a brain injury or infection, among other reasons, or as part of the aging process.  In their effort to find a cure, HA pursues a three-pronged strategy.  COMMUNITY: Hydrocephalus means a lifetime of uncertainty for the families and individuals who are confronted with a diagnosis or who are affected by the condition. Naturally, they want to learn more, to understand what the condition entails, what treatments are available, and they want to know they’re not doing this on their own. They understand this, because many of us have stood in those same shoes. To help, HA gathers together valuable resources and connects individuals to larger communities that can provide support and understanding. By providing an online library and common space for those dealing with hydrocephalus, HA works to reduce uncertainty, advance the overall hydrocephalus community, and provide as much insight as possible into what remains an often challenging and bewildering condition.  CLARITY: Despite its broad prevalence, hydrocephalus remains a misunderstood and often hidden condition, and the general population largely remains unaware of the breadth and depth of the impact of hydrocephalus. This lack of clarity complicates diagnosis, and not surprisingly, it also results in limited funding. For example, while hydrocephalus is 30x more common that Cystic Fibrosis, it receives only 1/13th of the federal research money.  HA works to educate national and state policymakers, the medical community and the general population about the nature and extent of hydrocephalus and to focus attention on the condition and the legislation/attention needed for individuals to overcome challenges.  Their Medical Advisory Board contains leading neurosurgeons, neurologists and other medical professionals and scientists to ensure that they are providing the most current and reliable information. They work to help others see the condition for what it is, so that it can receive the consideration it deserves.  CURE. Today, no cure for hydrocephalus exists, and the primary treatment – the insertion of a shunt into the brain – was developed fifty years ago and suffers from one of the highest failure rates of any surgical treatment. By focusing attention and research monies, HA works toward the ultimate end: a final cure to hydrocephalus. Little is known about the causes of hydrocephalus, but recent research offers hope that a cure is indeed possible. Already they are seeing improved diagnostic techniques. New valve designs are improving the efficacy of the shunts used to treat patients. New treatment options have opened up the possibility of a life without a shunt for some individuals. Studies in biomarkers and genetics are providing promising insights into how they might prevent the condition from occurring. This is the power that research has and every dollar matters. The more research we can fund now, the better the scientific foundation upon which future research will build. HA supports a Strategic Research Initiative that focuses on work that will truly advance our understanding of the condition, and with that, discover its causes, improve its treatment, and help us see an end to hydrocephalus.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydrocephalus-association,,https://twitter.com/hydroassoc,https://www.facebook.com/HydroAssoc,"315,100"

AIRE creates spaces and experiences to relax the body and mind according to ancient traditions of water with temperature contrasts as elements of relaxation and health. Aire de Seville was the first center and it was opened on the street called “AIR”, which gave the name to the whole business group. It is situated in an old mansion from the sixteenth century that a wealthy “Indiano”- the name for the men who made wealth in the Indies- built on the foundations of a Roman ruin from the first century AD (now where Flotarium is located) The building was completely rehabilitated to house the baths. After Seville, in 2008 Aire de Barcelona was inaugurated. This time the Baths were located in a former meat storage area of El Born Market where century old wells that had supplied the city with water were found. Under the brick vaults the Baths were situated in a careful process of the building restoration. The third AIRE arrived in Almería in 2011, this time in the Old Town Square in the center of the city. The bath has its own boutique hotel. The last center is in New York, a textile factory in TriBeCa, Manhattan. This building built in 1883 opened its doors in 2012 to Aire Ancient Baths New York.

Willard, Ed.D and Judi Zazula, M.S., OTR/L in Boston, MA, Helping Hands placed its first monkey helper in 1979.","Helping Hands Monkey Helpers for the Disabled Inc. trains and places monkey helpers to provide daily, in-home assistance to people living with spinal cord injuries or other mobility impairments. We carefully match monkeys and recipients, and actively support their partnership through mentoring and ongoing supervision of the monkey’s behavioral, nutritional, and veterinary needs. Thanks to the support of our donors, we provide these services free of charge to our recipients across the nation.  Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled has grown from an innovative idea into a successful, national nonprofit organization that offers independence and hope to individuals living with impaired mobility and severe physical disabilities. Since 2006, Executive Director Megan Talbert has overseen all aspects of the organization: monkey training, monkey health care, animal retirement, recipient applications, new placement, active placement, and the youth education program.  Co-founded by M.J. Willard, Ed.D and Judi Zazula, M.S., OTR/L in Boston, MA, Helping Hands placed its first monkey helper in 1979. That monkey, named Hellion, served as a helper and companion to Robert Foster, a Boston man living with paralysis, for more than 28 years until Robert passed away in 2007.  In 1982, Helping Hands became a 501(c)(3) corporation under the IRS code. From the beginning, Helping Hands’ mission has been to provide service animals to people who have become quadriplegic as a result of an accident, injury, or disease. Developmental grant funding from the National Science Foundation, the Veterans Administration, and from the Paralyzed Veterans of America supported the program’s initial research and development stage (which ended in 1989).  During its first decade, Helping Hands investigated and designed all of the components of the program—from determining which species of monkey was best suited for this work to the kinds of tasks the human recipients would need, and finally to the best methods for teaching tasks to the service monkeys.  In the 1990s, outreach efforts and coverage of our service monkeys in the media helped bring Helping Hands to the attention of the national public, and private donations began to replace the government funding that ended in 1994. Grants from private foundations, gifts from individual donors, and income from special events became a major source of support for Helping Hands. Workplace giving, especially by Federal employees giving through the Combined Federal Campaign, also supports our mission.  In response to changing technology, training protocols improved and refined as new tasks have replaced the old. Service monkeys are now taught to turn on computers and load DVD players, while the art of placing a record on a turntable has passed out of the repertoire. As the range of tasks taught in training grew larger, so too did Helping Hands’ ability to assist people with a wider spectrum of mobility impairments.  In 1999, Helping Hands undertook the search for a permanent and specially modified home for its training center. The Thomas and Agnes Carvel Foundation Center (also known as The Monkey College) officially opened in 2004. The mortgage and ongoing maintenance of The Monkey College marked a significant investment for Helping Hands and to this day represent a large part of our annual financial expenses.  Today, under the strategic guidance of their board of directors, Helping Hands continues to refine, improve, and broaden the many ways in which we pursue our unique mission.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/helping-hands-monkey-helpers-for-the-disabled,,https://twitter.com/monkeyhelpers,https://www.facebook.com/MonkeyHelpers,"329,872"

CureCoin,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/curecoin,http://www.curecoin.net,Association,Other,CureCoin is a CryptoCurrency based on the use of Folding@Home Protein Folding donations as a Proof of Work method.,"Network security from hashing is good. Making money is great. Curing Cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, preventing viruses, and designing next-level pharmaceuticals is awesome. What if we could put these together, to build a coin secured and run by crypto, mined with SHA256, and supported by cancer-curing research?  Announcing Curecoin!  What benefits does it provide? Most currencies are either in the CPU/GPU stage, or in the ASIC stage. Curecoin can be earned with both. Folders use high-end GPUs and CPUs to fold proteins, earning a proportional amount of coins set-aside for their contributions. Miners mine with SHA256 ASICs as usual, securing the blockchain for the Curecoin network. Whether you are heavily-invested in ASIC equipment or still have GPUs and CPUs, you can participate. Due to the nature of folding (diverse, constantly changing, not easily predictable), GPUs and CPUs will both always be relevant, so an investment in consumer hardware isn't wasted.  How is it different?   Curecoin allows owners of both ASIC and GPU/CPU hardware to earn. Curecoin puts ASICs to work at what they are good at--securing a blockchain, while it puts GPUs and CPUs to work with work items that can only be done on them--protein folding. While still having a secure blockchain, it supports, and thus is supported by, scientific research. While it isn't technically 'backed' by scientific research (there's no central authority you can visit to trade coins for scientific research) the coin has intrinsic value as both a currency and as a system of purchasing a tradeable representation of medical research. Similar to the idea of carbon offsets, someone with money can buy some Curecoins which represent a proportional amount of scientific/medicinal research, while someone with tech know-how can also contribute to the folding effort, doing the hands-on work, and gain profit. The value imbued into each unit of the currency from the folding network it represents would add additional traction and inertia to the coin's trading value. As time goes on and the amount of folding done for the network increases, the amount of research that each coin represents grows.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/curecoin/,,https://www.twitter.com/curecoin_team,http://www.facebook.com/Curecoin,"349,018"

In 1958, Pat Wasmond, a registered nurse and mother, was working in a local doctor's office. This doctor had a child who was severely handicapped, requiring 24 hour care. His family had difficulty managing this challenging situation. Pat offered her assistance and the child came to live with Pat, Bob and their children. Word spread in the Elgin area of this exceptional family and the wonderful care this child was receiving. Soon the Wasmonds began receiving calls from other families seeking this kind of help. It became evident to Pat there was a vital call for this type of care in the Elgin area. She and her husband decided to create a home for children with profound disabilities. Little Angels was founded. It all began with one family taking a child into their home.  And now, over 50 years later, Little Angels has grown into a 57 bed skilled care nursing facility. It remains owned and operated by the Wasmond family. In the 1970s, Pat and Bob's daughter Shelley became involved in the facility on a full-time basis and took over as Executive Director in 1979. Shelley, an RN, worked at Little Angels most of her life in one capacity or another, as did her ten brothers and sisters.

The Washington D.C.-based think tank was established in 2017 with one primary goal in mind: to provide policymakers, academics, and media professionals with impartial insights and illustrative commentaries on the socioeconomics and geopolitics of the Middle East. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to stimulate productive debate on domestic and foreign politics of key regional state- and non-state entities, as well as shed light on how those political shifts stand to impact the United States.  The Foundation observes developments as they occur across the Middle East; however, it maintains a particular focus on the nations embedded in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The region and its member countries are currently in the midst of a period of faced-paced change, the social, economic, and political implications of which could drastically impact not only residents of the Middle East, but the global community as a whole. Understanding this, the Arabia Foundation seeks to highlight and spark discussion on potentially significant regional changes, and provide an independent perspective on how these transformations stand to influence life domestic and abroad.  Anyone who keeps tabs on the region understands how invaluable these politically-independent insights can be; coverage of happenings in the Middle East is often opaque at best and limited by a lack of attention and colored by inaccuracies. The Arabia Foundation aims to remedy this lack of clarity and visibility by publishing reports, penning commentaries, generating analyses, and organizing events that both center on regional topics and stimulate productive conversations about current events. The Arabia Foundation has the capability to do so; the collective experience of the organization is considerable, spanning sectors that include but are not limited to finance, diplomacy, international relations, politics, and U.S. foreign policy. The organization's efforts have been fruitful thus far; in its first year of activity, Foundation experts have published op-eds and reports across significant media entities such as Politico, Bloomberg, and Reuters. Ultimately, the organization hopes that in providing these published perspectives, the Arabia Foundation will both serve as an invaluable resource for academics, media professionals, and policy experts who need a more layered and nuanced view into the region and provide a well-rounded, objective perspective on the Middle East to the public at large.   The Arabia Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that functions on the generosity of private donations and corporate support.

The understanding and shared approach to binary options trading is what connects all of the members of this trading community. We believe that as a group we will have a much greater impact on the binary options market and our personal trading accounts. Almost all of the readers in this community have gone it alone for many months or years before deciding to be part of this collective unit. The main principle shared by the members of the binary today group is to grow steadily without risking too much capital. We believe that traders should focus on keeping a reasonable money management strategy in order to keep the risk low. Too frequently in the binary options market, traders are tempted into high risk trading strategies, get rich quick schemes and automated systems promoted by marketers, not traders. We do our best to guide our members in the direction of real traders and helpful community members to ensure that they don't get caught up in the darker side of the binary options marketplace. The content we aggregate as well as write in this community include income reports, podcasts, videos, product reviews, education and actionable trading strategies. The podcast through 8 episodes is slowly teaching traders about the binary options market and what type of trading approach they should take based on their own personal preferences. We never want to force the members of this community into making decisions, rather help them find what's most suitable for their trading strategy. Many of the community members prefer short term expiry trades like 5 minute trades and 15 minute trades while others prefer 30 minute trades, 1 hour trades, 4 hour trades and even daily options trades. This makes the group often difficult to manage but it allows for numerous voices to share their messages and opinions on different trading styles. Many of the members that join Binary Today aren't sure what type of trader they are until they read through the thousands of comments to figure out the secret that is inside each and every one of us. Who we are as a trader is connected directly to parts of our character that we aren't even aware of, in this community helps traders tap into that potential and understand exactly the type of trader they need to be in order to be successful. Whether a trader prefers manual trading strategies or trading signals, there is always a place for them in the Binary Today community. We also play a very large role in the investigation and evaluation of binary options brokers. One of the  largest issues in the binary options market is the lack of regulation and the amount of brokers that are treating this like a wild West. We do everything in our power to ensure that the members of this community are aware of which brokers are reliable and which need to be avoided at all costs. As we make our way through this binary options journey, there is only one thing that we are truly sure of. We aren't going to get to our destination without the help of others.",,,https://www.twitter.com/binarytoday,https://www.facebook.com/binarytoday,"380,861"

Its purpose is to identify and analyze important issues to make globalization beneficial and sustainable for the people of the United States and the world and then to develop and communicate practical new approaches for dealing with them.

Its audience includes government officials and legislators, business and labor leaders, management and staff at international organizations, university-based scholars and their students, other research institutions and nongovernmental organizations, the media, and the public at large. It addresses these groups globally from its base in Washington. The Institute's staff of about 60 includes 20 senior researchers, as well as a dozen nonresident fellows, all distinguished for their combination of research productivity and policy experience. The Institute's agenda emphasizes international trade and investment, international finance and exchange rates, macroeconomic policy and crisis response, globalization and human welfare, and area studies of key economic regions. Institute staff have unique expertise on the major economies with special reference to China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, the European Union, and the Middle East, as well as the United States itself and its NAFTA partners. Current priorities include global supply chains and multinational investment; the growing role of China in the world economy; the economic dimensions of the Arab Spring; globalization, inequality, and unemployment; the global financial and economic crisis and especially its banking and monetary components; national and international financial regulations; trade negotiations at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels; and possible reforms of the international monetary system. Institute studies have helped provide the intellectual foundation for many of the major international policy initiatives of the past three decades: reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including those initiated by the G-20 in 2009–10; adoption of international banking standards; Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and Trans-Pacific Partnership; the restoration and then extension of trade promotion authority in the United States; North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other US free trade agreements (including with Korea notably); initiation of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China; reform of sanctions policy; liberalization of US export controls and export credits; and specific trade issues such as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China in 2000 and Russia in 2012. Other influential analyses have addressed: economic reform in Europe, Japan, the former communist countries, and Latin America (including what became known as the Washington Consensus); the social impact of globalization; foreign direct investment both into and out of the United States; international environmental policy; measures of currency manipulation and of equilibrium exchange rates; and the sources and growth of services trade. The Institute celebrated its 25th anniversary [pdf] in 2006 and adopted its new name at that time, having previously been the Institute for International Economics. In 2001 it moved into its new building, which received an Award of Excellence for Extraordinary Achievement in Architecture by the American Institute of Architects and a Best Architecture in Washington Award by the Washington Business Journal.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/1584176,,https://twitter.com/piie_com,https://www.facebook.com/PIIEonline,"393,395"

In 1996 Hoerni and Mortenson established Central Asia Institute (CAI) and appointed Mortenson as its director. Sadly, Hoerni wouldn’t survive to see the organization grow into an international, humanitarian force. Hoerni died in 1997 from myelofibrosis, a rare form of bone cancer, but Mortenson would dedicate the next two decades of his life to the charity.  Several years after CAI’s founding, Mortenson would co-author Three Cups of Tea, an account of his experiences in Pakistan. The book, a New York Times best-seller, and its sequel Stones into Schools, catapulted CAI into the global spotlight, giving the charity a powerful platform to advocate for peace through education.  Though Mortenson and Hoerni had no way of knowing when they first created the organization, CAI would change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Over two decades, CAI’s programs and projects have expanded into other far-flung regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, many of them too dangerous or isolated for other organizations to reach.  CAI has been successful in these areas because it maintains that the best method for sustainable, widespread change is to initiate projects requested by the community – ask communities what they need, don’t tell them. This philosophy has proven effective time and time again. To date, the organization has initiated over 400 projects, and hundreds of new requests for help cross our desks every day. We look forward to tackling these future projects, because we truly believe the surest path to peace it through education. With education we can change the world, one child at a time.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/central-asia-institute-inc-/about/,,https://twitter.com/peacethroughed,https://www.facebook.com/CentralAsiaInstitute,"404,055"
