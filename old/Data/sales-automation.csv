But it’s also a great opportunity for those companies that are able to get found by the right people, in the right places, at the right time, and most of all in the right context.  Approached correctly, with the right mindset, your company becomes seen as true industry experts and trusted advisors. You attract smarter clients. You gain much more leverage during the sales cycle. And you’re able to command premium prices, that protect your profit margins and your company’s future.  Is your company trying to grow its revenue more aggressively, so that it can achieve or maintain a dominant #1 position in your market?
