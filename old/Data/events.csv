We want to reinvent what businesses and individuals can do with mobile technology through the Zwoor.com platform, made for a new kind of worker, a new kind of workplace and a new kind of interactions. If you are an Conference or Tradeshow organizer, your event materials Go Mobile in just a few clicks.  Your attendees carry an iPhone, an iPad or an Android smartphone, and they now expect the agenda, the meeting materials, maps, exhibitors and alerts right at their fingertips. Our native apps do not require connectivity all the time, and we know that some of the conference or trade show venues are not built with connectivity in mind. We allow participants to store the data on the mobile device, and synch when connected. Zwoor Survey is a friendly, robust and cost effective survey platform that enables you to gather real insight into your event participants. Be that in a large,10,000 people keynote event with no connectivity, or in a small presentation, we can handle both. Zwoor Survey is a native application (vs. a web app), that allows timed surveys, answers to a challenge quiz for a prize, or just a simple multiple choice survey. We are not dependent on the connectivity in the venue – we know that some of the spots are without cellular or wifi coverage.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/2373442,,http://twitter.com/zwoor,http://www.facebook.com/Zwoor/155741147836727

The primary goal is to create a world-wide network that can transport real-time communications over secure standards-based channels and make it all accessible to developers and businesses using simple SDKs and programming interfaces designed to be powerful but simple-to-use. Audio/Video applications can be built with SignalWire that run in the mobile browser with no additional software and allow an experience that can unlock communications with a virtual office, AI bots, PSTN termination, gateways to remote call centers and much more.  With the evolving mobile SDK, rich applications can be built as native apps and the other side of every call is not just a ""room"" but a full-fledged routable telecommunications backend with additional programmable control for every call. SignalWire is founded on the principle of work-from-anywhere dating back to the turn of the century and continues that tradition with a fully distributed workforce spanning 16 US states and 11 countries in nearly every inhabited time zone. This remote culture has helped to shape the way our products and services have evolved and have proved to be invaluable amid the pandemic crisis in 2020. The core of SignalWire is made up of several networked nodes transforming the computing power of its host system into IP-based telecommunications relays that are demand-driven and horizontally scalable. The breadth of the SignalWire technology ranges from mature interfaces like SIP and PSTN to the state-of-the-art techniques in live video and HD audio. Unlike many ""video chat"" products and services, SignalWire goes well beyond basic capabilities and has dissected every moving part into programmable components that are on the bleeding edge of what is possible. SignalWire is evolving quickly into the first and only software-powered global telecommunications company delivering that as a service at the Infrastructure, Platform, and Application layer of today's communication stack landscape. Additionally, SignalWire is an active participant in the development and furthering of the standards on which the Internet relies for all of its real-time communications techniques.

Members can both “create a date” at the restaurant of their choice to be advertised along with their profile on the site or confidentially “show interest” in existing dates, where their profile will be visible only to the date host.   The problems this business is addressing are the following: Efficiency: Traditional online dating websites require an average investment of 10 hours online to meet someone offline. Our innovative approach streamlines this process from mate to date to a mere 10 minutes. Additionally, by allowing the member to preselect the day, time, restaurant and eventually the individual with whom he/she will meet, the process is mutually beneficial and convenient for both parties as the reservation is made automatically and all members have to do is show up and meet. Confidentiality: All profiles are private by default and dates can be scheduled without exchanging any private information. Additionally, these confidentiality measures prevent individuals from wasting time scanning hundreds of profiles on subscription based websites where 90% of profiles are “inactive” meaning not paying for a monthly subscription and thus unable to communicate online with other members. Our solution to this problem is that only active “dates” and their associated profiles are visible. Therefore members are only able to preview the profiles of those individuals offering dates or, as the host of a date, preview the profiles belonging to the individuals who are interested in their date.",,,http://twitter.com/OnlyADate,

Next release services will enable planners to search, find, compare and rate venues and will provide planners with proprietary tools to help them manage their events more efficiently. Today, the process of finding and booking a venue for an event is highly fragmented, highly manual and unsecure. Planners use multiple means (e.g., spreadsheets, calendar applications, phone, email, fax and in-person visits) to determine availability, reserve and book event space. Similarly, venue managers spend an enormous amount of time, through multiple, manual means , finalizing an event date, event package (menu, options, etc.) and meeting a clientâ€™s budget requirements  before their space is ever booked. In addition, venue managers do not have an integrated toolset to help them manage their venueâ€™s availability, to organize and respond to inquiries, distribute their product to a global audience, or to enable full transparency of the reservation and booking process in a secure environment. Pogby.com streamlines the fragmented event planning process to a convenient, easy to use, online-software service that results in: reduced time spent on compiling a proposal, increased productivity, and increased client customization for both the venue managers and the planners they support.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/2397314,,http://twitter.com/imbookin,http://www.facebook.com/imbookin

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization. Increase collaboration, drive sales, build better relationships, and deliver optimized omnichannel customer experiences. The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more.

Families connect via a mobile app to search, discover, and create local experiences to share with their young children. The Adventure Clubs free mobile app offers an opportunity for families with young children to easily create beautiful childhood memories. Forget about those cumbersome lists of what to do with kids in a particular city. Just because something exists doesn’t mean there will be any other families there when you go. And we all know, everything is more fun in a group.  Our kids need education, socialization and stimulation, and so do we. That’s why Adventure Clubs exists. This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for?
