We coordinate projects from beginning to end, and we stand behind our work. If we don’t reduce your home’s energy use, we don’t get paid. Mission: Sealed is on a mission to unlock comfort, value, and efficiency hidden in peoples' homes.  We offer smart home retrofits and turnkey project management to make upgrading your house a snap. Through our innovative performance payment program, we cover the upfront costs of the installations. Homeowners then pay Sealed using the energy they save. We believe in standing behind our work: if Sealed customers don't save energy, we don't get paid. Over 50% of single-family homeowners have significant comfort or other problems (health, safety, etc.) that could be solved with energy-saving upgrades (insulation, new boiler, smart thermostat, etc.). Most homeowners would prefer to pay for these upgrades with their energy savings rather than pay cash or take out a loan. But historically, banks have not been willing to lend money based on residential energy savings unless they feel confident in the underlying analytics. Sealed’s HomeAdvance financing program provides capital to cover the upfront costs of energy-saving upgrades. After the upgrades are installed, customers pay Sealed based on the amount of energy they save, guaranteed. Sealed’s proprietary data, analytics, and software enable investment-grade energy savings predictions. Sealed’s IP has enabled the first debt facility backed by residential energy savings cashflows (New York Green Bank) and the first residential energy savings insurance policy (Munich Re). Sealed reaches customers via local dealers (contractors), utilities, and digital marketing.

Typically, landlord portfolios experience between 5%-10% vacancy loss on rentals. Yet, perfectly good applicants are regularly declined due to blemished credit, student status, or other factors that do not impact their ability to pay. That’s where Leap helps. Our proprietary underwriting tools allow for quick and thorough vetting of potential residents which expands a landlord’s pool of qualified tenants and eliminates default risk.  There is no cost to the landlord as the one-time, upfront fee is paid by the resident and secures rental income for the entire term of the lease. Further, Leap accepts applications from tenants before they begin their apartment search, pre-approving them up to a certain monthly rent amount and delivering qualified residents directly to landlords.  Our goal is to improve the financial performance of landlords while helping people qualify for better apartments.   Our application takes 4 minutes to complete and can be submitted on a phone, tablet, or computer, and approvals take just 30 minutes during business hours. Furthermore, Leap can pre-approve renters for a maximum monthly rental amount for free. That way if you haven’t found an apartment yet, it’s easier to know what to look for. With Leap, renters can get the apartment they want, not just the one landlords say they qualify for. No apartment is out of reach, and that is a guarantee.

BeneFix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/benefix,https://benefix.us,"Health Insurance, Information Technology, Insurance, InsurTech","Financial Services, Information Technology",An open platform for the world to access benefits.,"In a part of the country where it’s more common to see an Amish buggy than an electric car, BeneFix, an insurTech start-up, is working to change how health insurance brokers manage small group benefits with their simple, speedy, and secure technology.  BeneFix offers health insurance brokers a digital platform that delivers 100% accurate quotes 100 times faster. Based in Lancaster, Pa., BeneFix manages data from thousands of plans  offered by major carriers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, offering quotes in minutes from a simple-to-use online interface reminiscent of Zillow. Less than two years after founder Matt Ranauro first had the idea for the platform, the business had a brick-and-mortar office in Lancaster City, over 1,000 customers, and, most recently, became one of nine central Pennsylvania finalists competing for a $100,000 investment from AOL co-founder Steve Case’s “Rise of the Rest” initiative.  The success is due, Ranauro believes, to three factors.  First, his own passion for the product. Ranauro has co-founded several tech companies, most notably ILL Co., a company that has built apps for HBO and Nickelodeon, analytics platforms for KPMG and products for the Mayo Clinic. With each company, Ranauro needed to find health insurance for himself and his co-founders and employees. “It took about two months just to find out what was available, then get enrolled in those products.” He said. “Which seems crazy, right? In 2017?” The question became: how do we streamline this and make it a better experience for everyone? Ranauro’s previous experience is the second factor that contributes to the success and growth of BeneFix.  The final is the Insurtech industry itself.  With insurance, and health insurance particularly, still lagging behind other industries in terms of using and creating technologies that work, the Insurtech industry, a $4.5 trillion industry, has attracted the attention of venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs alike. Lancaster (Ranauro’s hometown)  may be Amish country, full of farms, buggies and country roads, but BeneFix is out to prove that it’s also fertile soil for creating a company that will revolutionize the health insurance industries’ outdated model.

ClinicsNow! enables millions of transactions each year by managing customers and their health data across the entire ecosystem; driving out fraud and friction to shorten the sales cycle. Customer Problem - Long sales cycles cause life insurers to lose customers. Each interaction increases the chance of customer attrition. Clinical data collection required to complete underwriting of life insurance applications is one of the biggest contributors to this attrition. Lastly, the current model for capturing that data, and the healthcare infrastructure which presently exists, are not equipped to effectively provide this service. Target Market - The life insurance industry is demanding more reliable applicant health data; needing it faster and in greater detail than ever before. Installing our ClinicsNow! IoS software at urgent care clinics across the US, we supply our customers with biometric examinations, customized services, medical histories and other risk-related data. We have two major carriers in contract negotiations and 200 clinics under exclusive contract; our target is 6,000. Business Model - Force Diagnostics charges transactional fees from life insurance carriers for the collection and transmission of policy applicant data. Our ClinicsNow! software is an Internet of Services (IoS) solution which connects thousands of urgent care centers into a single network; enabling our life insurance customers to rapidly access health data and accelerate their sales cycles. Servicing up to 15MM applicants per year ensures long-term value. Customer Segments - We are an insurance underwriting data services company. Annually, there are 15 million applications for individual life insurance policies. Customer segments are represented through agents (captive and independent), direct marketing, and online sales. Greater flexibility, lower fixed costs and speed of service delivery creates value, while the intense customer-service focus of the urgent care industry provides unique advantages to each segment. Sales & Marketing Strategy - Life insurance companies require health data to assess risk of policy applicants, and have been forced to rely on a fragmented independent contractor model which complicates the sales cycle. This industry is highly relationship driven. To acquire customers, we have hired respected industry professionals with established relationships. Demonstrating our ability to improve policy ""taken"" rates ensures customer retention. Competitors - Competitors follow an independent contractor model which provides limited control over the customer experience, unpredictable service availability and lack of flexibility.

Not long ago, Bill experienced a series of health issues that forced him to rely on his personal Medicare Supplement Insurance. With heart surgery, emergency appendicitis, open-heart surgery, and knee surgery all in a two year period, Bill quickly exceeded his Medicare coverage, with bills totaling well over $400,000. Click for a look at Bill’s medical bill. “It was unbelievable!” Bill laughs. “I have been so healthy for my whole life, but in that short period of time I was hit from every direction, and I would have had to pay almost half a million dollars in medical bills if I didn’t have Medicare and my Medicare Supplement Insurance plan. Instead, I paid nearly nothing. More than ever before, I see the value we provide to our customers at SeniorQuote.” In the early 1970s, Bill worked with the Waddell and Reed life insurance model which promoted low-cost term life insurance in place of higher cost whole life insurance with the proposition that the difference in premium (premium savings) should be invested in mutual funds for retirement. In the 1980s, Bill was a founder of SelectQuote Insurance Services, one of the first life insurance agencies to offer a term life insurance quote comparison service. The SelectQuote service was designed to assist people by providing affordable rates available from highly-rated life insurance companies. In the 1990s, Bill was a founder of First Union Insurance Services, which offered affordable term life and permanent insurance to support the needs of the bank’s many customers.  For the past ten years, Bill has keenly focused on the needs of Baby Boomers; helping them to replace their term life insurance with affordable permanent life insurance, and helping them sort through their Medicare and Medicare Supplement options as they approach the mandatory Medicare age of 65. A senior himself, Bill has become an advocate for seniors. Through SeniorQuote, Bill leads his experienced team of insurance professionals to search for healthcare coverage that fits the specific needs of his customers.",http://www.linkedin.com/company/3237758,,http://twitter.com/SeniorQuoteIns,http://www.facebook.com/pages/SeniorQuote-Insurance-Services/589168961127307,"76,504"

These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation. All mentioned issues makes customers unsure and unsatisfied. Autonomous/self-driving From the autonomous/self-driving point of view the goals are: decimeter grade of absolute positioning within a global reference frame, relative localization/location displacement estimation accuracy – 10 cm per 100 sec, speed estimation accuracy – 5 cm/sec, course estimation accuracy – 0,1-0,5 deg. Effective integration of navigation and machine control information sources as GNSS, IMU (gyro, accelerometer), 3D compass, Digital Map, Radar, Lidar, Image-based Positioning and Computer Vision. Solution to the navigation/positioning task mainly within GNSS+IMU+3DMap+Image-based Positioning techs. To allocate the Computer Vision and Radar/Lidar techs mostly for obstacle avoidance, objects recognition and machine control functions. Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic approach to urban mobility and autonomous/self-driving technology solution concludes in deep engineering synthetic navigation design consist of: tight couple integration of GNSS with internal sensors (IMU) using raw data of satellite receiver, map based corrections (road graph and turns matching), image-based positioning (reference points detection and images recognition; no permanent scene analysis typical for obstacle avoidance, no high power and computation consumption). The software only product using just a platform sensors running on smartphones and in-dash auto systems. Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis.  Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers. Demonstration of results The video of the technology real time tests on Android smartphone will be demonstrated in the frame of presentation. Interested customers will be welcome for field tests.

Since before our founding in 2010, CHSI Technologies has been working to build technology for where the insurance industry is headed, not where it’s been.  That’s why CHSI was one of the first companies to build our $20 million software product on a cloud-based platform.     Our roots were established in the management and operations of insurance pools, captives, and insurance companies.  So, our deep experience and understanding of insurance operations serve us well in building technology that is responsive to the type of insurance operation it serves.  And our industry experience supports our clients well when it comes to deploying our technology into their unique environment in a meaningful way.   Our cloud-based technologies allow us to offer top-tier enterprise qualities to small insurer operations for a fraction of the cost of similar systems used by the mega-carriers.   Our product and approach ensures that small insurers can stick to their core competencies while enjoying the benefits of having a robust back-end system that serves as an integrated workforce multiplier… in other words, - higher, easier output - at a lower cost of operating.  Our lineage also facilitates our understanding of the budget constraints faced by most small insurer operations.  As a result, we have priced the product in a modular way that allows the customer to license only those features and components that best serves their current mission. And as the customer grows, they can add other modules and features as their business needs and demand evolve.    Today, our SaaS enterprise product is being used coast to coast by traditional workers’ comp carriers, P&C carriers, captive insurers, government risk pools, and self-insured groups.  We are honored to be recognized as a Top Ranked technology by numerous CIO and insurance industry publications, as well as having been voted as the winner of the US Captive Award in 2017 for technology.   For some companies, they would see this recognition as a signal that they have arrived – for the team at CHSI, we see this as nothing more than a “good start”.

The infant Company had no capital and was housed in one room of a bank building.  Auto-Owners operated in Mt. Pleasant for a little less than a year. In 1917, V.V. Moulton literally picked the Company up, placed it under his arm and in his pocket (the Company consisted of one book of policyholders' names and $174.25 in assets), and moved Auto-Owners to Lansing, Michigan. It wasn't long before the Depression began, and Auto-Owners weathered even the lowest point of that era - the bank holidays of February 1933. The Company demonstrated its corporate toughness and financial stability by paying all claims promptly, daily, and IN CASH! The firm was then writing more than $2.5 million in insurance premiums. Auto-Owners entered the general casualty insurance field in 1940, having previously written only automobile insurance. During the next five years, the Company found it necessary to acquire three more buildings in the vicinity of its main office to accommodate its continued growth.
