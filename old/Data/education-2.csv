zyBooks,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zybooks,http://www.zybooks.com,"E-Learning, Education, Publishing","Content and Publishing, Education, Media and Entertainment, Software",zyBooks publishes interactive textbooks that utilizes animations and embedded tools.,"zyBooks was started in 2012 by Smita Bakshi and Frank Vahid. Frank is a Computer Science and Engineering professor at the University of California, Riverside, and Smita, prior to her 10 years in the high-tech industry, and was a UC Davis Electrical Computer Engineering professor.We started zyBooks to help college STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) students graduate. More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.  Professors include Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), and Andre Knoesen & Raj Amirtharajah (UC Davis). Starting with just a handful of universities in 2012, our computer science and engineering zyBooks are now used at over 200 colleges and universities and a few dozen high schools.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/zyante,,https://twitter.com/zybooks,https://www.facebook.com/zyBooks/

The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online. While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids. Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨ Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience. We hope that you enjoy Zoodles as much as we do! â€¨",,,http://twitter.com/zoodles,

His clients spanned the globe and all industry segments.

Fast Company judged WAY to be one of the top world changing ideas of 2019. Noted media experts and social networking companies believe what WAY has developed will inevitably disrupt and replace the way human beings communicate with themselves and their computer screens. What WAY has invented (5 seminal patents and more pending) is an elegantly simple multi sensory universal language that for the first time enables organizations and individuals to accumulate, access and apply a systemic lens to everything complex - with an attractive entertaining gaming-like interface,, paint by numbers touch, no language barriers, feedback loops for mass action reward and recognition, transparency and proof verification on top of AI and Big Data, and ubiquitous potential.  WAY's new pattern based semiotic language will disrupt and revolutionize commerce, the internet, social networks, finance, healthcare, organizational management systems, AI/Big Data/IT, education and economic systems worldwide. WAY's invention is an entirely new paradigm that declares that our inherited deficient languages - how people think, communicate and act - are actually THE problem. The solution is an accumulative multi-sensory language built upon ontologically organized universal cellular models filled with pattern and sound to signify meaning.

TRAIL,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trail,,"EdTech, Education, Employment, Mobile","Education, Mobile, Professional Services, Software",Digital Learning Platform,"Digital literacy is an internationally recognized problem. TRAIL is the first to market with an open learning platform that leverages powerful data to help community advocates and educators alike to empower users. The goal of TRAIL is to provide a suite of lifestyle management applications, rooted in a core digital literacy curriculum and partnered with state, federal and non-profit institutions to provide effective and empowering solutions to social issues. Right now, JobScout is getting people to work. Our first platform, JobScout, teaches the essential Internet skills needed to find a job in today’s online marketplace. Despite the growing importance of the Internet in American life, 1 in 5 Americans are not digitally literate. That means there are 60 million Americans who do not know how to use the Internet. This number is nearly 6 billion people worldwide. High-speed Internet access and online skills are not only necessary for seeking, applying for, and getting today’s jobs, but also to take advantage of the growing educational, civic, and healthcare advances spurred by broadband. Statistics show stark demographic disparities in digital literacy. Senior citizens, Spanish speakers, adults with less than a high school education, and those living in low-income households are the least likely adults to have Internet access. Ten percent fewer Hispanics and African-Americans use the Internet than whites. Moreover, only 6 in 10 Americans go online wirelessly with one of their own devices, so public institutions are serving a crucial need in providing access to the American public. But do they have the resources and the tools to provide Internet literacy trainings to those who need it most? That’s where JobScout comes in. The career training program industry is a billion dollar industry with lackluster results. Our competitors are in-person training programs in the workforce development space. JobScout is innovating the career training space through technology to offset the costs and resource burdens of traditional workforce development. JobScout is part of inaugural efforts in the State of California and nationwide to support digital literacy, so the platform has no direct competitors. In essence, we are the first to this market space that is hallmarked by bureaucracy and desperately in need of re-imagination.",,,http://twitter.com/discovertrail,

We have taught thousands of students in over 40 countries across the globe to learn to trade Mirroring the growth of the entire industry, Trading Advantage has evolved from its roots to the Trading floor. Larry Levin, founding partner and president, has deep ties to the trading floor as he began as a runner at the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the early 1990s.  Larry quickly climbed the ranks from phone clerk to desk manager to eventually trading his own account. At the height of his trading career, Larry averaged between 2500-3000 S&P contracts per day to become both a profitable and respected trader in the E-mini S&P 500 futures pit. From his years of experience on the trading floor, Larry recognized that successful trading over the long haul requires a sound strategy and a specific plan. Sensing the inevitable shift away from the open outcry pits to an electronic marketplace, Larry founded Trading Advantage to share the secrets of his success with a larger audience. He partnered with Josh Lewis in 1998 and they are joint owners of the company.. Now a nationally recognized media figure, Larry has been interviewed hundreds of times on virtually every major financial media outlet including CNBC, Bloomberg TV, and Fox Business News. Over recent years, Trading Advantage has grown to a full-fledged investment school with a staff of 40 plus dedicated industry leaders. We are committed to being both technological and educational innovators as we continue to refine, improve and update our infrastructure and educational materials. We have partnered with industry leaders who are at the technology forefront including Lightspeed VT , ESIgnal and Bluewater Trading Technology. Trading Advantage has kept pace with the evolution of the financial industry by empowering and educating the individual investor so they can compete in the new technological paradigm. The historical models which had the individual investor being heavily reliant on a financial planner, a stock broker or a banker to both control and execute their investment decisions have dramatically changed. Technological advances and the evolution of a global and more open marketplace make it easier for the individual investor to control their financial future. Trading Advantage has honed in on this demand by providing education solutions so students can effectively learn to take control of their investment portfolios.   We are committed to delivering innovative solutions to our student base via virtual classroom learning environments and one on one educational experiences delivered through state of the art technology. Trading Advantage has built a strong instructor team and developed educational platforms for all major market sectors including multiple future markets, options and stocks.

Our vice president, Russell Short, is a native West Virginian who has seen the effect of poor training in these high risk industries and the impact it leaves on the community and state as a whole. He is proficient in multiple programming languages and has a passion for graphics and interactive software.   We came across the following over and over and over. Current safety training was ineffective and the people that needed it the most just didn't do it. The current training methods just didn't work. And to top it off, this was REALLY important safety training. The kind that keeps a person alive in high risk scenarios. And sadly, people die because of this. All the time.   Why train people if your training is not fully effective? How can we improve current training methods?   Our solution to these issues is to use Virtual Reality (VR) to develop customized training programs that people will be excited for, something that makes people use their bodies, voice, and brain.

To that end, The Programming Foundation aims to meet several goals: The Programming Foundation commits to spreading awareness and education on computer programming and operating systems so that everyone is involved, and no one is left behind while the world advances. Our goal is for the widespread adoption of new and enhanced curriculum on computer programming and operating systems and for this knowledge to become mainstream in the general population. Without adequate instruction and training on advanced procedures in computer programming and operating systems, our children and the rest of the community will fall far behind technology. Automation is replacing jobs at a fast rate, and education behind that technology needs to ramp up to a similar speed. One way to stay on top of the continued advancements is to educate the general population and the younger generations on computer programming and operating systems. This education will produce a collaborative society that applies their collective knowledge toward technological innovations. We are already surrounded by devices that are smarter than the average human. This technology is becoming more widespread every day, and our lack of proper education on the subject leaves many behind on how it works. To keep everyone on the same level and to move society at the same speed as technology advances, we need to implement far-reaching educational systems to teach and learn how these technologies work. Together, we need to improve on our current educational processes and find better solutions. The Programming Foundation is dedicated to improving the available solutions so that we can make computer programming and operating systems education mainstream. We are committed to open-source and plan on developing and involving our volunteers in building industry standard technologies and applications that solve real-world problems and make the world a better place. Our objective is to maintain our goal of continuous technological developments and to encourage every citizen to learn more about computer programming and operating systems so that together, we are a smarter population.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-programming-foundation,,https://twitter.com/forasmarterus,https://www.facebook.com/smarterus

The cost of college textbooks has doubled the rate of inflation over the past 20 years.  Students spend over $4.9 billion on college textbooks each year with few alternatives to help them save money.  The average yearly cost of textbooks has increased from $898 in 2005 to over $1,000 in 2006.  Every year television reports and newspaper columns have stories about the rising prices of textbooks and the lack of options available for the students, but there still has been very little progress in this industry. Textbook Revolt began addressing the problem of high priced textbooks by experimenting with a completely free college textbook exchange named Socialbib.  The site has received many accolades from students who were previously dissatisfied with the options available to them.  As a result, students from over 1,300 schools nationwide joined Socialbib and posted over $1,000,000 in college textbooks. Research proves that although online retailers such as Ebay and Amazon have added competition they have not significantly changed the landscape of the textbook industry.  Demand is rapidly increasing as the overall cost of education continues to rise.  It is evident that this problem will continue to exist as long as students are not presented with compelling alternatives.  The knowledge gained though Socialbib gives Textbook Revolt a competitive advantage to be the first service of its kind to market.

We were recently awarded patents covering a variety of  areas, from our primary specialty of natural language processing,  to Monte Carlo simulation of risk assessment in finance and automated methods for lock/key drug discovery in biotechnology.  For now, our primary focus is in designing applications for natural language immersion in virtual reality tailored to the the linguistic competence of each individual user. Our intent is to develop educational tools that specifically target vocabulary competence, the best indicator of overall academic achievement.  We are specifically interested in leveraging a variety of linguistic laws, like the Heap-Herdan law of vocabulary growth, to tailor and optimize the educational experience so that their vocabulary acquisition for each user is grown in solidarity. Hopefully this software can then be used to help correct the 70 point drop in verbal S.A.T. that occurred in the United States, in the years between 1957 - 1972 ,due to the national standardization of primary academic textbooks.

The Problem Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both.  Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach.  Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates. Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide. The Solution SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches & enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance — for example ""How to close the sale."" Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his ""SureSpeak"" he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format — based on customizable categories such as body language, tone, enthusiasm, message content, sincerity, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc. SureSpeak's patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous — meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts — practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.",,,http://twitter.com/SureSpeak,

Daily national news stories remind of us all of how kids are bombarded by bullying, profanity, nudity, sexting and more on their smartphones. The list of internet threats to teens and tweens only continues to grow. Instant access to Cyberspace via smartphones has dramatically changed parenting, and parents worry and wonder what they can do about these complex problems. In response to these threats, a couple of dads who saw their teens engulfed by their smartphones for hours every day said “enough is enough”. They set out to develop an app that is so technically advanced that it can lean forward into the swarm of new teen apps coming at kids at an ever-increasing accelerated pace on the internet. Social Judo was born, the app that uses the power of the internet against the power of the internet. This app shows what current content is on a child’s phone, analyzes it, and reports back to a parent if there is concerning content or even possibe danger. This new app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to Help Social Judo scour the internet and identify new dangers and threats. The AI component of Social Judo then brings that information back to the development team with ideas and suggestions on how to protect your kid from the dangers of these new apps without spying on them.  Dr. Matt Philips, a brain surgeon and visionary behind the development of this new app said; “I want to help establish the paradigm of parenting children in Cyberspace. We parent at home, we parent on the playing fields, we parent at school, but in the one space our kids spend 5-6 hours per day, goes unparented and virtually unsupervised. “It’s not your child that you need to be concerned about”, continues Philips. He notes it can be the other kids your child interfaces with daily. All it takes is one kid showing your child porn, or nudity, or explaining sex without love, and, once that has happened, you can’t take it back, you can’t un-see it. In most cases, you’re not even aware this has happened. Getting an alert sent to a parent’s phone that your child has been looking at or has been sent these kinds of messages or images is what Social Judo accomplishes, Dr. Philips calls it a “parenting moment”. From the parent’s app on a smartphone, they can lock a child’s phone, making it impossible to continue to be bullied or sent this kind of material. If you’re interested in talking about cyber bullying, the neuroscience behind smartphone addiction, teen suicide or “death by smartphone”, and a whole host of other subjects, then Dr. Philips, the new national expert on these subjects, would love to chat with you. Like himself, he wants other parents to be aware of the dangers of smartphone use and abuse that our children are being exposed to every day.
