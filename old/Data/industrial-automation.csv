Soft Robotics,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soft-robotics-inc-,http://www.softroboticsinc.com,"Advanced Materials, Industrial Automation, Robotics, Software","Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Software",Soft Robotics opens new markets to automation through the application and commercialization of its proprietary soft robotics technology.,"The business end of a robotic arm is the gripper. The March 2105 edition of Modern Materials Handling best describes the challenge when they wrote:  “Perhaps more than any other element of robotic development in warehousing and distribution, the end-of-arm tooling, or gripper, is the place that can make or break a robot’s success.”  Advancing gripper technology is the key to unlocking a new age of automation. An age where they can automate tote pick and pack for grocery distribution, bin picking of soft and delicate parts, e-commerce order fulfillment, fruit harvesting, luggage handling, and consumer goods packaging. The US fresh produce packing market alone represents a $27 billion retail market searching for automation solutions. Soft Robotics has demonstrated the ability to bring robotic product handling and packaging to this market.  These are problems of adaptability, complexity, and cost. The search for a more adaptable gripper has driven up the complexity of design to devices like servo grippers and complicated tool changing requirements. This complexity comes at a high price in gripper cost, the need for larger arms, and complex software and hardware integration.  Their revolutionary soft robotic technology, covered by more than 40 patents and applications, enables us to design and manufacture soft robotic hands that address the new unstructured world of automation and logistics.  Through their propriety knowledge of actuator geometry, material selection, and operating envelope, they can tune actuators to be force limiting with NO CLOSED LOOP FEEDBACK system required. Soft Robotics brings the highest level of adaptability, while lowering system complexity and total system cost. The adaptive nature of their technology allows a single grasper to handle an unprecedented range of objects, regardless of shape, size, or weight, with no tool or software changes between cycles.  We’ve demonstrated the ability to grasp bags of rice, raw food, bars of soap, boxes of toothpaste, and clothing all with a single device.  But soft does not mean weak. Their technology has the ability to scale from the smallest to the largest task. The result is an automation solution that can pack a tote for retail distribution, pick fruit off the vine, or easily handle a ten pound kettle bell.  They have demonstrated the speed and precision necessary to integrate into the factories and warehouses of today and the future, operating at speeds up to 130 picks per minute.Their system is plug and play with the most common industrial robots using industry standard protocols and vision systems.They have designed the system to be “robot and vision agnostic,” allowing the system to quickly and seamlessly integrate with the full range of robots, from small collaborative systems to high speed industrial packing cells.  Soft Robotics launched their industrial product at Automate 2015 in March 2015, Their produce handling system in June 2015, and started shipping in June 2015. They are now selling systems to their pilot customers.

OneCharge operations cover the US, Latin America, Europe and CIS countries. OneCharge’s client portfolio includes leading multinational companies. The industrial lithium-ion battery market reaches $ 1.5 billion and is growing rapidly. OneCharge has been an industry pioneer and currently is the market leader in the USA. The company sells large quantities of industrial batteries for warehouse equipment. It successfully collaborates with such market leaders as Hyster-Yale, Crown, and Toyota. It’s been highly recognized by customers, dealers, and manufacturers. Lithium-ion batteries accelerate the development of the conservative forklift market. The companies who use them manage to improve their competitive positioning on the market as the batteries provide higher machinery performance.  While competitors are mainly focusing on R&D activities, OneCharge is commercializing lithium-ion battery technology. OneCharge is able to reach specific market niches via increase of its sales as well as better product adaptation for client needs. The company aim is to create easy and ready-to-use solutions for a wide range of industrial clients. This strategy has allowed the company to enter into American market rapidly. OneCharge acts as ‘change ambassador’ in relation to new technologies implementation. The company is continuously investing in technological development. It has been exploring new chemical compositions for batteries that could reduce the cost of the product, balance, and improve it. New developments are quickly implemented in the production process and are gradually becoming new benchmarks on the market. As the industry leader, OneCharge sets the standards from technical solutions to new professional terminology. OneCharge batteries are available to mass industrial consumers. They are delivered via application of EaaS (energy-as-a-service) concept, which previously had a very limited presence on the market. The batteries are equipped with remote data collection and monitoring systems that enable the computation of the energy produced. As a result, the client pays only for the energy consumed, rather than the cost of the battery (which is comparable to the cost of the forklift truck itself). The company does a lot to ensure that the maintenance of its batteries is as simple as possible. It has developed a special modular component system that allows for repair of the batteries without disassembling them. This approach streamlines service department training in order to accelerate the lithium batteries’ expansion into the market. OneCharge has invested in increasing the voltage used in batteries as well. It enhances significantly the efficient energy use for warehouse equipment. Such industry leaders as Hyster-Yale Group support the company in this initiative and willingly contribute to the promotion of high-voltage batteries on the market.",https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/18055099/,,https://twitter.com/onecharge_us,https://www.facebook.com/onechargebatteries/,"162,312"

The story of Crane Cams began in 1953 when Harvey J. Crane, Jr. set about grinding his first camshaft in the corner of his father's machine shop in Hallandale, Florida. An apprentice machinist, young Harvey became interested in ""souping-up"" his flathead Ford V-8 hot rod. Like most others, he was strongly influenced by the various ""hot rodding"" magazines, ordering his first cam from a California cam company's ad.  The first cam Harvey purchased performed well, but when he ordered another, he found it was not at all like the first, mostly due to manufacturing and machining inaccuracies. Harvey's machinist's training and hot-rodder's ingenuity had already taught him that camshaft design and accuracy exacts a critical effect on engine power. Harvey also knew he was easily capable of designing and manufacturing camshafts. What's more, he knew he could design more powerful, far more accurate and repeatable camshafts.  Today, Crane Cams has a significant amount of R&D and manufacturing resources to rely on, including an immense number of state-of-the-art CNC machining centers, dyno cells, Spintrons and a fully government-certified emissions lab. The company has the ability to produce fully digitized camshafts using Landis CNC equipment, as well as grinding cams via traditional methods using production masters. Quality control is assured through state-of-the-art Zeiss optical and Adcole equipment.  With the industry's largest camshaft database, which exceeds 80,000 profiles, an impressive manufacturing capability, and an experienced tech staff (most of whom have 15+ years service with Crane Cams), the company stands ready to provide customers with industry-leading quality products and superior service.

The patented technology uses sound waves to non-invasively detect blockages in segments of sewer collection pipe by quickly inserting a portable transmitter and receiver into either end of the pipe or through a network of stationary devices that can maintain continuous assessment. The innovation of the underlying technology lies in the fact that it uses an ACTIVE transmit and receive process to assess pipe blockage conditions as compared to the reflective nature of similar applications such as SONAR or ultrasound.  The active transmit and receive process works extremely well in gravity-fed sewers to detect abnormalities in a simple, low cost, and straightforward way.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/infosense_inc/,,https://twitter.com/InfoSenseSLRAT,https://www.facebook.com/InfoSenseIncSLRAT,"424,976"

It leverages a new application of the fundamentals of science, Real-Time Modeling and Machine Control, to improve compressor performance while reducing its energy footprint. This approach is a fundamentally different method of operation than traditional compressor control systems. It is an edge computing solution that leverages computing power embedded into sensors to sense and receive precision feedback to build a 360* real-time model.  This model is employed to perform optimal control based purely on the physics of the air compressor machine and process.  The competitive advantage lies in the proprietary computing methodology used to perform the real-time feedback, data analysis and modeling. Conceptually, the Compressor Controller works through sensors and actuators (device to assist in machine operation) that feed into and are controlled by a working model. The model receives synchronized sensor input on the environment and the machine operation to constantly calculate and implement the optimal actuation in the moment. This model-based approach allows the control system to always compare the actual compressor operation against the scientific ideal and automatically implement the necessary adjustments accordingly.
