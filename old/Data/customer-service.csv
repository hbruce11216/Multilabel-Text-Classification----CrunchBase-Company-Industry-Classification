It is not entertainment or communication; it simply saves the money everyone pays monthly. Hitbills found an easy way to reduce costs – just scan your bills with smartphone, or simply tap “Yes”, geolocalization and automatic data gathering algorithm will find you better deals.  HITbills conducts auction for commodity suppliers in your area  (electricity, gas, phone, Internet,  TV, bank services and loans refinancing) with one-tap switch if you decide. Why money can be saved ? The secret of business is that due to global deregulation, there are plenty of cheaper providers (or cheaper banks), offering exactly the same product with lower margin. We talk about really big money (according to Forbes’s list of Top 1000 companies by revenue, commodity sector is  the top – because everybody pays bills – Google ranks at #63, Facebook at #101). Average savings per household are 10-40% (depending on localization) – multiply it by 12, and imagine that you got 1000$ for extra holidays – it is what HITbills does.  And there are 500+ millions households qualifying for reducing bills. Why money can be earned ? Moreover, HITbills gets commission for every switch – the money companies usually pay to their agents or for media advertising – and passes it to smartphone owner (holding %). So customer has double benefit – cheaper utilites + cashback.  And, if you want to get some extra money, you can scan bills of your friends, neighbors, family– everyone saves, you earn. Millions of people use the homebills price comparison websites, but the process is too complicated for 60% of households.  HITbills makes it simple - just scan bills with smartphone. How does it works ? Technically:  the scanned bill goes through OCR , where anonymous usage data are being extracted:  then supplier bid for the bill in real-time reverse auction: finally, the user gets savings . It consists of smartphone app + OCR system + comparison engine + affiliate network. All elements are popular, so this invention can be quickly launched to any market. Where it works ? Hitbills started in Poland; it looks for VC, price comparers, entrepreneurs and partners worldwide, especially in Europe and USA, where the deregulation of energy market is forced by law. The technology and business method is patented in Europe and USA.  HITbills offers master license per country, promotion and shares for local-market partners.",,,,,"75,773"

AIRE creates spaces and experiences to relax the body and mind according to ancient traditions of water with temperature contrasts as elements of relaxation and health. Aire de Seville was the first center and it was opened on the street called “AIR”, which gave the name to the whole business group. It is situated in an old mansion from the sixteenth century that a wealthy “Indiano”- the name for the men who made wealth in the Indies- built on the foundations of a Roman ruin from the first century AD (now where Flotarium is located) The building was completely rehabilitated to house the baths. After Seville, in 2008 Aire de Barcelona was inaugurated. This time the Baths were located in a former meat storage area of El Born Market where century old wells that had supplied the city with water were found. Under the brick vaults the Baths were situated in a careful process of the building restoration. The third AIRE arrived in Almería in 2011, this time in the Old Town Square in the center of the city. The bath has its own boutique hotel. The last center is in New York, a textile factory in TriBeCa, Manhattan. This building built in 1883 opened its doors in 2012 to Aire Ancient Baths New York. Each AIRE is unique, located in an old building full of history and personality, but all of them share the quest to create a space for relaxation, full of calm and serenity in an experience for the senses.",,,https://twitter.com/ancientbathsny,https://www.facebook.com/AncientBathsNY,"322,152"
