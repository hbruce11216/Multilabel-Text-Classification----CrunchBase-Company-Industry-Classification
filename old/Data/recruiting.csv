The 'dedicated talent' model allows our customers to hire engineers employed by IT consulting agencies. The agency acts as a recruiter and employer of record. It also often provides additional services, such as training and social program for the employees. The main perk of this model is that the customer doesn't need to compete for quality talent. Once you find the engineer that matches your criteria, there is no more need to worry that a competitor will beat your offer or your star freelancer will kiss you goodbye for a more lucrative gig. Your engineer is dedicated - which means 100% of their time is reserved for working on your project. One thing YouTeam is adding to this, is that as a marketplace, we operate the talent dynamic availability data across the pool of 20,000+ engineers employed by several hundred vetted agencies in 19 countries. This allows to skip the recruitment phase entirely. All engineers are ready to start instantly and the customers usually have multiple candidates to choose from. This model allows us to get the best from the two worlds: reliability and quality of full-time employees with the speed-to-hire and flexibility of freelancers.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/3742074?trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CentityType%3AentityHistoryName%2CclickedEntityId%3Acompany_3742074%2Cidx%3A1,,https://twitter.com/youteamUK,https://www.facebook.com/youteamUK/?fref=ts,"19,890"

Relationships matter. Sometimes in the hi-tech world they live in today, it’s easy to forget that. But they have always been keenly aware that the point of a good CRM system is to help build better relationships, and that all of their features should meet that criteria. After years of success in the recruitment industry, the founders of TrackerRMS grew increasingly frustrated that the CRM systems available in the market weren’t really built from a recruitment industry insider’s perspective.  There were a lot of venture-funded CRM platforms targeting the industry with big investments backing them, but none of them really seemed to ‘get’ the business from the perspective of someone that was actually in the trenches of the industry every day. So after six successful years of owning and running a recruitment business, David Alonso decided to sell and form TrackerRMS with Andy Jones, committed to building a CRM that is 100% focused on the recruitment industry, and has equal focus on relationships and the bottom line.  Their mutual passion for recruitment and building better business systems provided the fuel to get TrackerRMS started, and they quickly launched their initial product with good traction straight away.  Customers understood that the founders of TrackerRMS knew the market well, and realized that their personal experience helped build a product that would work for recruiters as well as business owners.  At TrackerRMS, their team is committed to always remembering that relationships are the foundation of success for their customers.  Their vision is to continue to support the SMB space and to help them grow their recruitment businesses by using TrackerRMS to build better relationships and to run their operations more effectively--the end result being increased growth and profitability, which is what their customers are all ultimately after.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/255252,,https://www.twitter.com/tracker_rms,https://www.facebook.com/trackerrms,"48,669"

GoldCleats provides players with the opportunity to showcase their talent to teams, scouts, agents, and coaches. On GoldCleats, you can connect and communicate with your teammates, friends, and coaches through the inbox messenger feature. You can also find an agent to represent you or simply showcase your talent to a scout or team looking for new talent. Recruiters such as scouts, agents, coaches and teams will join GoldCleats by end of summer 2014. GoldCleats is currently open for players and GoldCleats Coaches only. This gives each player a chance to work on their profile before recruiters join. After signing up and logging into your account, a player must click on the profile tab to input and store their personal and technical information. Players can upload and store as many videos as they want. Players are encouraged to showcase their skills through their videos and earn GoldCleats skill cards. Players can also customize their news in their News section. This allows a user to decide where they want to receive news from and what kind of content they would like to read. This helps our users stay updated with the world and be the first to get the news and inside scope on their favorite players, coaches and teams. GoldCleats also offers two types of evaluation tests. The Skill Evaluation Test is designed to test a players individual skill. A Match Evaluation Test evaluates a players performance in a game. Both tests require players to upload their own footage with no editing. Once the video is uploaded, a player may choose one of our GoldCleats Coaches to evaluate them. Our coaches will fill out an evaluation form with a final grade. Players may then choose to post their evaluation and their final score on their account dashboard for others to view. GoldCleats does not guarantee that any player or all players will get recruited, however it allows players to measure their chances of getting viewed by a team, coach, agent or scout by frequently checking their Experience Bar (EXP). The EXP indicator measures the attractiveness of a players account and their chances of appealing to others. Teams, scouts, agents, and coaches will always prefer to look at an account with an EXP indicator that is 50% or over. Players will earn and receive points each time they edit or add information on their account. Additional points are earned every time a player completes an evaluation test or fills in the information required in areas marked with an EXP symbol.",,,http://twitter.com/goldcleats,http://www.facebook.com/goldcleatsglobal,"69,829"

A growing number of Fortune 500 companies are utilizing RecruitiFi's ERS platform to quickly fill their open positions with vetted, qualified talent. As an added benefit, the Expert Referral System streamlines agency interaction, allowing employers to manage their existing suppliers, vet new agencies, and utilize RecruitiFi's crowd of proven, expert recruiters at a low, flat placement fee.  How does it work for Employers?  Employers invite their current recruiting agencies to work at their existing fees, while leveraging RecruitiFi’s community at one low, flat fee. Recruiters are then scored in real time as employers view, sort, disposition, and hire their candidates. This allows the platform’s algorithms to match future jobs to a subset of qualified recruiters based on their performance on similar searches. The ERS eliminates the need to review recruiters based on anecdotal observations, automatically vetting new agencies and managing existing recruiters based on real data. It’s quick, confidential, easy, and taps into new pools of talent, resulting in higher quality candidates and a reduced time-to-hire.  How does it work for Recruiters?  Using a recruiter’s preferred industries, roles, and locations, the algorithm provides closely matching job requisitions (JobCasts). RecruitiFi actively vets all JobCasts, ensuring they have an active hiring need and do not have candidates in process. Additionally, the ERS platform requires detailed employer feedback, while RecruitiFi’s account managers provide a direct line of contact, eliminating the notorious ""Resume Black Hole."" The result: more transparency and more placement fees.

What College Recruiter is the leading, interactive, recruitment media company used by college students and recent graduates to find great careers. Our clients are primarily colleges, universities, and employers who want to recruit dozens, hundreds, or thousands of students and recent graduates per year. How One of the things that we've learned since our founding way back in 1991 is that the recruiting needs of every organization is different and often varies depending upon the year, season, and even candidate. One organization may not be generating enough qualified applications and so their need may be to greatly increase the quantity of applications at a low cost per application. Another organization may be overwhelmed by qualified applications but not receiving enough from diverse candidates. They may be best served by reducing the quantity and increasing the quality of applications by targeting just the diverse candidates. You know your recruiting needs better than we can ever hope to. We know our solutions better than you'll ever want to. Our consultative, data-driven, client services team will follow the process we've established -- the College Recruiter Difference -- to ensure that we understand your needs, work with you to select a campaign designed to meet those needs, implement the campaign so we maximize your return on investment, and then follow-up with you to review the outcomes.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/collegerecruiter-com,,https://www.twitter.com/entryleveljob,https://www.facebook.com/entryleveljobs,"191,887"

For clients, we take the time to discuss what type of engineer (and beyond) you want. Not simply what’s on the job description (anyone can put a keyword search together). We want to know the specifics. Gaining an insight to your company culture and the driving mission behind creating the product/service are essential to the success of our recruiting efforts. The same principles are applied to all the candidates we work with. We know the majority of you are happily employed, however we also know there’s an ideal opportunity that could make you even happier. We don’t want to throw a bunch of companies your way and pray you pick one. We want to know what technologies/languages you love and what type of problems you want to tackle on a daily basis.

Universities and professional associations engage with iRelaunch to provide turnkey career re-entry programming for alumni and members, through live events, webinars, and online content. The iRelaunch Return to Work Conference has been held 21 times since 2008 and is the signature event nationally for the relaunch market, drawing a combined audience of over 6,000 attendees.
